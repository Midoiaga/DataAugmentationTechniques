- You're not a guest of the hotel?
- No, anybody can see that!
Please, no need for shouting.
Then why don't you give me my letter?
What's the use of asking me foolish questions?
I'm afraid I have to ask you to leave the hotel.
Well, I won't go till I get my letter!
I'll be compelled to call the police.
Well, call the police.
Call anybody you like.
I'm not a criminal.
I haven't done anything wrong.
Mister, please.
I don't want trouble for the hotel.
All I want is my letter.
It's from my daughter, see?
It came all the way from Spain.
Just a moment.
- lloyd.
- Yes, sir?
Do you remember a letter addressed to Mrs...? E. Worthington Manville
Yes, it came in this morning.
There, you see?
I told you it was here.
Let her have it.
God bless you kindly, sir.
God bless you.
Why are you standing there?
I sent it back.
You sent it back?
Sir, there's no one registered here under that name, so I sent it back marked "party not known here".
But you can't.
She'll find out that I'm not living here.
- Don't you see?
- Please, please.
Has the mail left yet?
Yes, the boy took it out a few minutes ago.
It's probably...
There he is now.
- Hey, boy, boy!
- Please.
Don't put any more in there!
Don't put any more...
You can't do this here.
She's quite crazy.
There it is.
I knew it was here.
I'd know it any place.
Leave this hotel at once.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
She's fainted.
It's an old lady.
Come on, grandma.
You all right now, mother?
I'm...
Where's my letter?
Where's my letter?
- Here.
- There you are.
- Do you feel alright?
- Now leave me alone.
I'm all right.
Nothing's the matter with me.
So, if my daughter comes here, all you gotta do is say that I'm dead.
That ought to be easy enough?
It won't do the hotel any harm.
"Mrs. E. Worthington Manville passed away last week."
That's simple enough.
Oh, yes. Say there was a funeral, a big funeral, and lots of flowers, and all the prominent people came.
If they ask about Mr. Manville, just say he was so broken up he had to take a trip around the world for a year.
Make it two years.
That'll do the trick.
Pretty slick, isn't it?
It's Apple Annie.
- Come on, Annie.
- Will you do it for me?
- I won't bother you any more.
- Take her out of here.
- Come on, Annie.
- I won't... you've got to.
- You can't let me...
- Come on, never mind.
You've gotta! You've gotta!
Sure, we can talk business if the proposition's right.
No, we want the whole stable, every horse in it.
Look, three sixes.
Listen, Babcock without Sun Count or Beau Geste, we wouldn't give you counterfeit script for the whole outfit.
Okay, how much you want?
What?
He'd take a hundred grand.
It's a steal.
A hundred thousand?
What do you boys expect us to do, rob the Mint?
Okay, if I can line up the Dude, we'll step around and see ya.
It's a pushover, Dude.
Babcock must need the money.
Take it from me, you're lucky.
Which of these vests do you like, the white or the striped?
Let's get going.
We can knock this deal over in an hour.
I can't find her, Boss. Can't find her no place.
- Can't find who?
- Apple Annie.
I looked high and low for her.
She ain't nowheres around.
That's why you were stalling.
What do you mean, "couldn't find her"?
I get a lot of help from you guys.
I feed you pretty good.
You got dough in your pockets.
I know what I'm doing and I don't go into this deal till I get an apple from Annie.
Listen 'stupe', all you had to do was ask any panhandler on Broadway.
That's just it, there ain't no panhandlers on Broadway.
What?
Listen, I hope my mother croaks if this ain't the truth.
I walked over town for hours.
Ain't a beggar on the streets.
I suppose they're all in Europe on vacation.
Search me. It's got me scared.
Broadway looks like a morgue.
Blind man here.
His name is Shorty.
- Shorty?
A blind man?
- Yes.
Bring him in.
None of them around, eh?
Get that dizzy dame off your mind.
I don't think about her in the daytime.
Let 'em in.
- Hello, Dude.
- Hello.
- What do you mugs want?
- It's about Annie.
What about Annie?
I've been looking all over town for her.
She's in an awful jam.
- Been drinkin' again, huh?
- No, it ain't that.
Notterhead found her walking by the water.
Yeah, she was in a daze.
She was walking down the waterfront, talking to herself.
Good thing Notterhead ran into her.
What is all this?
- She's in an awful jam.
- I heard that.
For years she's been swiping stationary from the Marberry.
And writing her daughter she's in high society.
- Daughter?
- She's got a daughter in Europe.
Been in a convent ever since she was a baby.
Sends her money every month.
Now she's gonna marry a Count or something.
What is all this, a racket?
Anybody know where she lives?
- First Avenue, 314.
- Remember that. I'm going there.
Okay, you mugs. Out of here!
Come on, you heard.
Happy, go to Babcock's and stall him till I get there.
Shakespeare, come along with me.
As soon as I get my apple i'll meet you over there.
As I live and breathe, my old friend, the Dude.
Come in, gentlemen.
I thought so. On the gin again.
Where's your apples?
Come on in. The butler will take your things.
You didn't know I had a butler, did you, Dude?
I've got lots of butlers, millions of 'em.
Where you been, you old buzzard?
I've looked all day for you.
So good of you to come down for the hunting season.
Everyone always comes down for the hunting season.
Dude, let's get out of here.
When she's crocked, she pulls this 'society' stuff.
Gives me the creeps.
You trying to kill yourself?
You know what Doc Michel said.
This stuff'll poison you.
Hey, Boss.
This must be the daughter them panhandlers was yappin' about.
You haven't met my daughter, have you?
She's coming over to visit me.
Isn't she lovely?
She's coming over here... with a Count.
She's gonna marry the Count's son.
That's the kind of people I associate with.
Funny, isn't it?
She thinks I'm in high society.
Wait till she sees me!
It's going to be funny when she finds out her mother is Apple Annie.
Why don't you laugh?
Why don't you laugh?
It's funny, I tell you.
Apple Annie, from Schubert Alley.
Apple Annie... from Schubert Alley.
Old fool, getting herself in a jam like that.
Remind me to send Doc Michel down here.
- What you gonna do, Mr. Dude?
- Do about what?
About Annie.
What do you mugs want me to do?
We thought you'd figure it out.
We had a meeting and someone said: "Ask the Dude."
That's all I got to do?
Go on, beat it.
If Annie could get an apartment at the Marberry for a week...
- We'd pitch in for some of it.
- Yeah, we'd all help.
- Annie at the Marberry?
- Yeah.
Go on, get out of here.
- Come one.
- Come on, scram everybody.
The nerve of those guys.
Annie at the Marberry.
Hey Dude, mind if I have an idea?
Yeah.
This here society friend of yours, Rodney Kent, he's got an apartment at the Marberry.
What about it?
What about it?
Can you see me asking Rodney Kent "Lend me your apartment for Apple Annie?"
He'd throw me out on my rear.
I was just gonna say that.
"He'd throw you out on your rear."
- Shut up about it, then.
- I was just gonna do that.
- Where have I seen you before?
- Whom do you wish to see, sir?
- Is this Rodney Kent's apartment?
- Yes, sir, but he's away.
What gave you the idea I give a hang where he is?
Well, I assume...
Don't assume so much.
It'll get you into trouble.
- Yes, sir.
- Come here a minute.
I'll tell you something that will upset the rest of your day.
- I don't care about Rodney Kent.
- No, sir.
Toddle in there and tell Dave the Dude I wanna see him.
- He is in there, isn't he?
- Yes, sir.
Who should I say is calling?
Happy McGuire, apple of his eye, that's who.
- You got that straight?
- Yes, sir.
I have it.
Don't let it upset you.
Four out of five have it.
I promise not to get depressed.
And remember, if you take one drop of gin...
Now, here's the layout.
Here's your bedroom, see?
That's over in the corner.
The Count is here, the son here, your daughter's here.
Now, you got that straight?
Here, you better keep this.
Fine mess you got everybody into.
Everybody worrying about you.
Why didn't you swipe stationary out of the White House?
Then you could've said you were the President's wife.
- Mr. Happy McGuire.
- 'The boy with the sore feet."
You know I've been looking for you for two days?
What's this?
Meet the new society lady.
Hotel Marberry, daughter. Where'd you ever get a daughter, anyway?
Who's the father?
Who's the father?
I suppose you'll tell me he was a big shot or something.
Rodney Kent gave you this apartment for her?
Yeah, must be as big a sucker as I am.
He must be off his nut.
"The whole thing sounds insane, but go ahead, use the apartment.
My only request is make certain no one puts mustaches on the paintings."
Say, listen, come over here.
I want to talk to you.
Get this, I got the Babcock deal all set, get me? It's set.
Now that's our bread and butter.
What's this?
You're not doing yourself any good here.
Yeah, I know. You think I'm screwy, but I got an idea.
For years Annie's been lucky to me, ain't she?
What luck would I have if I passed her up now?
Miss Missouri Martin.
- Fetch her in.
- Missouri Martin?
Yeah, the old gal herself.
How is it, boys?
Come on, gang.
How's my baby?
Cut it out, cut it out.
Here they are, suckers, the gang that keeps me broke but beautiful.
All ready for the slaughter.
Now where's the victim?
There she is.
And what material for a bunch of hungry artists.
Look at 'em, tongues hanging out.
