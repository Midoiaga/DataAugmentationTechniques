The astronomers are assembled in a large hall embellished with instruments.
The president and members of the committee enter.
Everybody takes his seat.
The scheme is approved by many. But one member violently opposes same.
After some argument, the president throws his papers and books at his head.
Upon order being restored, the trip proposed by the president is voted by acclimation.
The man-servants bring travelling suits.
We enter the interior of the workshop where smiths, mechanics, weighers, carpenters, upholsterers, et cetera are working hard at the completion of the machine.
Micromegas accidentally falls into a tub of nitric acid.
A workman informs the astronomers that if they would ascend to the roof, they will witness a splendid spectacle:
the casting of the gun.
Against the horizon, the chimneys are seen belching forth volumes of smoke.
Suddenly, the flag is hoisted.
At the signal, a mass of molten steel is directed from each furnace into the mold for the gun.
The mold pours forth flames and vapor.
On the top of the roofs of the town, pompous preparations have been made.
The shell is in position, ready to receive the travelers.
These arrive respond to the acclamations of the crowd and finally enter the shell.
A marine closes the bridge through which they have passed.
A number of gunners are pushing the shell up an incline into the mouth of the gun.
The bridge is closed.
Everyone is waiting for the signal which starts the shell on its voyage.
The gun is fired and the shell disappears into space.
The shell coming closer every minute, the moon magnifies rapidly until finally it attains colossal dimensions.
Suddenly, the shell pierces the eye of the moon.
The shell comes down with a crash.
The astronomers get out and are delighted at the landscape which is new to them.
Against the horizon, the Earth is rising slowly into space illuminating the picture with a fantastic light.
The astronomers see craters everywhere.
Just as they are about to explore, an explosion throws the unfortunate men violently in all directions.
They stretch themselves out on the ground and go to sleep.
Seven gigantic stars representing the Great Bear appear slowly, and out of the stars come faces of women who seem annoyed at the presence of these intruders in the moon.
Then, the stars are replaced by a lovely vision of Phoebes on the crescent, of Saturn in his globe and of charming young girls holding up a star.
They decide to punish the terrestrials in an exemplary manner. By order of Phoebes, snow is falling from all quarters, covering the ground with its white coat.
The cold becomes unbearable.
So the unfortunate voyagers wake up half-frozen.
They decide without hesitation and in spite of the danger to descend into the interior of the great crater in which they disappear one-by-one whilst the snowstorm is still raging.
The astronomers arrive into the interior of a most curious grotto filled with enormous mushrooms of every kind.
One of them opens his umbrella to compare its size with the mushroom, but the umbrella suddenly takes root and transforming itself into a mushroom starts growing attaining gigantic proportions.
The astronomers suddenly notice strange beings coming out from underneath the mushrooms while making singular contortions.
These are the Selenites, or inhabitants of the Moon.
A fantastical being rushes on an astronomer who defends himself and with a stroke of his umbrella the Selenite bursts into a thousand pieces.
But the Selenites are arriving in numbers.
The astronomers are captured, bound and taken to the palace of the King of the Selenites.
On a splendid throne, surrounded by living stars, the Selenite king is seated.
President Barbenfouillis makes a dash for the King of the Selenites and lifting him like a feather throws him violently on the ground.
The astronomers run away in the midst of the general disorder.
The astronomers run at full speed turning around each time they are pressed too closely and reducing the fragile beings to dust.
At last, the astronomers have found the shell and quickly shut themselves in the interior.
Thanks to the advance, they have succeeded in getting over their adversaries.
Only one, the president, has been left behind.
He rushes to the rope which hangs from the point of the shell and letting himself slide down the rope he gives it an impetus which causes the shell to fall off the edge of the moon.
The shell falls with sickening rapidity.
The sea appears.
The shell balances and thanks to the hermetically sealed air in its interior rises slowly to the surface.
The shell is picked up by a steamer which tows it to port.
The Mayor welcomes the astronomers with a speech, and the general ovation awaits their happy return.
The film, HAUNTED CASTLE (Schloss Vogeloed), was restored in 2002, using the following material:
an original negative of the Federal Film Archive, Berlin and a celluloid, tinted copy, with Portuguese intertitles from the Fundacao Cinemateca Brasileira, preserved in the Federal Film Archive in Koblenz.
Most intertitles were kept from the original negative and have been extended for reconstruction.
The missing intertitles were reconstructed using the script and a list of titles Decla-Bioscop filed on 31 March 1921.
The new intertitles used the original format And bear the logo FWMS.
The work was done in collaboration with the Federal Archive

But, alas, only fifteen minutes later ...
The day.
"His Reverence, Father Faramund, has just announced his arrival for tonight."

Nightfall.

"He wanted a saint ...
And he wanted to see in me only the qualities of a saint ..."
"So for months ...
I froze ... the purer he became, my attachment to the mundane seemed more terrible..."
"I was craving ... to do something evil ... wanting something evil ... "
"That's when I met Baron Safferstätt ...
"My husband wanted to give away all his possessions, and distribute his assets to the poor, and that brought many conflicts with his brother ... until, one night, a complete breakup occurred."

My husband ... was shot dead."

"I have informed the authorities of my suspicions about this Count Oetsch...!"
A happy man.
"She is so strange... she doesn't say a thing, even not about the Father who disappeared?"
At noon.
"Have you ever murdered anyone?"
"What ... did you say ... that?"
"Gentlemen!
Why not let me finish speaking?"
"Last night I had a dream!"
"Count Oetsch!
"Believe me, my investigating eye is experienced!"
"...and yet, Count Oetsch is involved in the Father's disappearance."
"He is acting so superior in order to conceal his new crime."
"He will have to apologize for his inappropriate joke in the presence of all the guests!"
"You absolutely have to speak to him.
"You already know everything, Sir!"
"Perhaps you also know who is suspected of causing the Father's disappearance?" causing the Father's disappearance?"
"Me!"
"But, I know even more, Mr. Ex-Justice.
I also know how to discover secrets."
"To give you an example, I am now going to give away one of the Baron's secrets."
"Count Oetsch!
"My compliments for your opinion!
I just want to whisper a few words into Baron Safferstätt's ears."
"No. ... no ...
I am ... not a murderer."
"What are these suggestions?"
"Do you perhaps suddenly accuse the Baron of the assassination of your brother?"
"Perhaps?"
"I will question Baron Safferstätt."
"Today I'll find out!"
He murdered my husband ...!
He shot his own brother during an argument!
End of the Fourth Act.

Fifth Act
Half an hour later.
"What do you know of that day, my dear - speak!"
"My Lord, the Count, preferred to run away!""
"And so I tell you, he has the disappearance of the Father also on his conscience."
"Father Faramund... has returned again!"
"Yesterday I was seeking comfort, and you did not come!
- I will make my confession to you!"
"Because you, as a priest, must keep silent!"
"We must not do anything now!
The events of these last days will now probably clear up!"
"A few days before the murder of my husband ... "
"I am appalled at such holiness ...!"
"I'd like to see something evil ... something very very evil!"
"A murder ... !"
"Baron Safferstätt, burning with passion for me, had terribly misunderstood me!"
"He killed my husband!"
"He confessed to me two days later."
"Then I realized I was guilty. "
"The Count was arrested.
We would have been poisoned ... to prove his innocence ... "
"But, he was not convicted!"
"Thus accursed, both of us! Fearing life!
Fearing death. "
Tied together by our guilt!"
We got married!
That is our marriage!"
"So we became two comrades!
"I implicated Count Oetsch in the murder of his own brother!"
"I have followed my destiny so far!"
"Now you know everything!
And you must remain silent!"
I ... I understand!"
"Act like a man!"
"I ... was ... not happy ..."
"A shot ...?"
Evening peace.
"His struggles are over!"
"I, who was innocently accused, had always guessed..."
"So, some way had to be found for me finally to clear myself from this ignominious suspicion!"
"So, I arrived before Father Faramund, who was also expected at the castle!" Thus I came to the castle to await Father Faramund!"
"We have to beg your pardon for so many things!"
Nightfall.
"I am Father Faramond of Rome."

PARIS ASLEEP
One evening, Paris went to sleep and the following morning the night watchman in the Eiffel Tower wonders why not a thing is stirring in the city and since no one comes...
CHI EF OF POLICE
At the Paris airport.
"Everything came to a standstill last night except for me up in the Eiffel Tower."
"And us in our plane."
A thief always comes in handy.
"We mustn't let it get us down!"
"I'll see that every shop is open for you even the Bank of France!"
Paris is all theirs.
But what good are riches when you're bored?
"If anyone's listening please come to...
A handkerchief in the window."
"This is where the powerful rays came from that put everyone to sleep."
"It's my uncle, Professor X!"
"You must wake everyone up!"
"I never thought of that!"
"I'll give it a try."
"It's 3:25 a.m., the same time."
"You betrayed me!"
"We're going to make some money... thanks to your uncle's invention."
"The whole city was asleep for four days."
"You all say the same thing!"
"We're all telling the truth."
"Go tell your tales somewhere else."
"Did we dream this whole thing up?"
"No, it wasn't a dream!"
At the beginning of the Middle Ages the legend of the mandrake was born.
According to legend, a root was transformed into a human being.
We have to go out at night to find the root, when the clock strikes midnight.
You should place the stick into the ground below the gallows.
The root of the mandrake, with its strength and Magic brought fortune to men, but misfortune and pain.
His Excellency, Professor Jakob ten Brink was famous for his ability to experiment with the hereditary character of man.
During my studies, I have found the legend of the mandrake, and now I look at this old superstition scientifically.
We know the wind carries pollen from flower to flower ... without any will, without a certain goal.
And thus was born in the laboratory the animal laboratory.
I wanted to discover:
Is character inherited from the parents or just by chance?
I always say to my students:
We should overcome the road open for experiments Teacher's Voronoff. XXX
Above all, we should pay attention to the results.
Because then we open new possibilities for the study of humanity.
Franz Braun, nephew of the teacher.
Wouldn't these men just mock you, uncle?
On the contrary!
It would be the biggest experiment of my life:
Creating a man in the laboratory.
A being with a hereditary character that does not come influenced by the parents.
The woman must be of the same qualities as the land fertilized under the gallows, the "mandrake" must come from the dregs of society
While the prison administration got a man for the professor,
Franz Braun was looking for women for his uncle needed to perfect the experiment.
Alraune, daughter of sin ... from the dark days of superstition.
Franz Baum his uncle was looking for the ideal woman he needed for his experiment
Forget that your plan violates nature, the finest of life ...
Beware: the legend of the mandrake is real!
It will become a living being, but it lacks the warmth of life, and bears the cold of death inside.
I tell you, the legend of the mandrake is true. It is a living being that lacks the warmth of life and bears the cold of death within itself. Be on guard consequences of your action ...
Nature will have her revenge!
Alraune be educated at school Convent of the Sacred-Heart.
I cannot do this to my parents!
I want to do everything you want.
On the bank of the Industry and Credit.
Mom sends you greetings.
And the Mandrake?
The evolution of Mandrake.
24 October 1908 It is a success, with the help of my nephew, the creation of a Mandrake root.
He is a dreamer, I, by contrast, am a man of science ... I am above prejudice.
According to legend, the mandrake brings fortune and wealth.
Today I have selected a name: Alraune ten Brink.
It is blasphemy ... and you will be punished.
Alraune disappears without a trace ...
-School of the Sacred Heart convent.
I want champagne!
At one stop, Alraune lies for the first time to people from a traveling circus.
Aren't you afraid of a mouse?
After months of investigation, Alraune ten Brink was found.
In the end, I knew I would succeed.
Alraune, doesn't it embarrass you?
I'm scared of you.
You used to be my nephew.
We moved away until your story was forgotten.
Enough of this visit by a gentleman.
Who do you think is your father?
I offend, Alraune.
If you knew where you came from!
... and then presented in high society.
Father, come here!
Surprisingly, father, we seem so little alike.
Do I look more like my mother?
Yes ... I think of your mother often.
What if she looks like her mother?
Never!
Dear lady, I want to ask the professor for you hand.
Sorry, sir ...
Alraune is yet very young and should remain with me.
Tonight at eleven I flee with her.
What a shame ... An experiment by a cynical scientist ... a daughter of vice and crime.
What is my place among men?
I play him.
I get even with him.
You are right ... I stayed with him.
Dear Dad, I think you're jealous.
His letter was brought to me here.
In the diary of my "father" I read everything that happened before my birth.
Have mercy on me ...
I want to know everything.
I'll give you everything you want, but we go from here.
Alraune ... you and me ...
You're a cheater! What were you thinking? I have now learned that this woman is not you daughter.
I cannot deceive you.
You must stay with me, or I will kill you ...
Dear Professor!
It is as if a ghost followed you ... as if a devil wanted to harm another.
All speculation has failed ...
She has destroyed ...
Come to the gaming table, Alraune.
You will bring me luck.
Play red, the color of good fortune.
Red five times in a row.
Place your bets!
For the ninth time the ball has landed on red.
I want to leave.
We have not lost everything yet, Alraune.
We still have your jewels.
We have not lost everything, Alraune.
We still have your jewelry.
Yes ... but not with you ...
Take me out of here ...
Give me another soul, a heart ... and I will become a human being and love as a human being.
Alraune began a new life together the one she loved.
And the one who violated the laws of nature, fell into a hell of loneliness and insanity.
-Thirty thousand.
- From the Russians?
No, from the French.
From the Russians we capture more than that every day.
Mr. Postman.
War is war and schnapps is schnapps, and business must go on.
You didn't leave the mail yet this morning.
Ah, I'm sorry, Mr. Meyer.
Hello, Himmelstoss.
Anything for us today?
- No, no, Master Peter.
- Oh, there must be something.
Here, here you go, young lad.
There.
This is the last mail I deliver anyhow.
- What?
- Tomorrow I change uniforms.
- You're going in the army?
- Yes, I was called.
I'm a sergeant in the reserves, you know.
I'll be called myself, if it doesn't end in a few months.
- It will, though.
- I'm sure you're right, Mr. Meyer.
Now, my beloved class, this is what we must do:
Strike with all our power.
Give every ounce of strength... to win victory before the end of the year.
It is with reluctance that I bring this subject up again.
You are the life of the fatherland, you boys.
You are the iron men of Germany.
You are the gay heroes who will repulse the enemy... when you are called upon to do so.
It is not for me to suggest that any of you... should stand up and offer to defend his country. But I wonder if such a thing is going through your heads.
I know that in one of the schools, the boys have risen up in the classroom... and enlisted in a mass.
But, of course, if such a thing should happen here, you would not blame me for a feeling of pride.
Perhaps some will say... that you should not be allowed to go yet, that you are too young, that you have homes, mothers, fathers, that you should not be torn away.
Are your fathers so forgetful of their fatherland... that they would let it perish rather than you?
Are your mothers so weak that they cannot send a son... to defend the land which gave them birth?
And after all, is a little experience... such a bad thing for a boy?
Is the honor of wearing a uniform... something from which we should run?
And if our young ladies glory in those who wear it, is that anything to be ashamed of?
I know you have never desired the adulation of heroes.
That has not been part of my teaching.
We have sought to make ourselves worthy, and let a claim come when it would.
But to be foremost in battle... is a virtue not to be despised.
I believe it will be a quick war, that there will be few losses.
But if losses there must be, then let us remember the Latin phrase... which must have come to the lips of many a Roman... when he stood embattled in a foreign land:
"Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori."
"Sweet and fitting it is to die for the fatherland."
Some of you may have ambitions.
I know of one young man who has great promise as a writer, and he has written the first act of a tragedy... which would be a credit to one of the masters.
And he is dreaming, I suppose, of following in the footsteps of Goethe and Schiller, and I hope he will.
But now our country calls.
The fatherland needs leaders.
Personal ambition must be thrown aside... in the one great sacrifice for our country.
Here is a glorious beginning to your lives.
The field of honor calls you.
Why are we here?
You, Kropp, what has kept you back?
You, Mueller, you know how much you are needed?
Ah, I see you look at your leader.
And I, too, look to you, Paul Baumer, and I wonder what you are going to do.
- I'll go.
- I want to go.
- Me too.
- I'm ready.
- I'm not gonna stay home!
Follow me!
Enlist now!
- No more classes!
- Don't be a quitter!
- Come on, Behn!
Stick together. That's what we've got to do.
- Let's all stick together.
- Come on, Behn.
All right.
All right. - I'll go.
- That's the way!
Let's go!
Let's sing! Come on!
- Keep in line there, soldiers.
- Anything you say, General.
Detail, halt!
Left face!
Get into uniform, ready to report.
Fall out!
I betcha a place like this gets you in good condition.
You have to be for the long marches.
I'm gonna get in the cavalry and ride.
No cavalry for me.
Infantry's where you see the fighting.
Where are all the guns?
That's what I want to know.
Oh, you don't get a gun for a long while yet.
If I'm gonna bump off the enemy, I gotta have some practice.
Bayonet drill. That's what I want.
Ah!
You won a medal that time, Mueller.
You wait.
In about a month I'll be covered with 'em.
Say, keep your boots out of my face!
Why, it's an honor to have those boots in your face.
They're the best pair in the army!
My uncle gave 'em to me.
Just look at that special imported leather.
Put 'em anyplace you like, except in my face.
Not even a kitchen maid'll look at me in this!
Attention!
Well, for the love of -- It's Himmelstoss!
- So it is.
- And all dressed up.
Hello, Himmie.
You didn't think you'd see me again so soon, did you?
- You see my rank?
- Sure.
Fall back, then!
- Himmelstoss, we certainly are glad to see you.
- What did you say?
- I was going to say-- - Never mind!
- What's the matter with you?
- When you address your superior officer, say "sir"!
- Where'd he get such a nice uniform?
- Any mail for us, Himmie?
- Quiet!
- My dear fellow, you're shouting.
Ah, come on, Himmelstoss. We know ya.
Take off the false whiskers.
- I believe you mean it!
- You'll find out that I mean it.
- But only three days ago you were our postman.
- Silence!
Come back here!
Line up!
Line up!
Get in some kind of a line!
All of you!
Line up, I say!
What a pretty sight that is!
Have you never heard of standing in line?
You make a fine mess of it.
Well, I'll have to teach you.
We'll spend the whole day on it, huh?
You may be stupid, but I'm used to that.
And then there'll be plenty of other things too.
Oh, I'll not neglect you.
You're not much to begin with, but I'll do my best.
I see that we have come here with a slight misunderstanding, and we'll correct that, too, won't we, huh?
And the first thing to do is to forget everything you ever knew.
Everything you ever learned, forget! See?
Forget what you've been and what you think you're going to be.
You're going to be soldiers, and that's all!
I'll take the mother's milk out of you!
I'll make you hard-boiled!
I'll make soldiers out of you or kill you!
Now... salute!
A-ten-hut!
Detachment... lie down!
Head down!
Keep your head down, Baumer!
Detachment... get up!
Now sing!
Do you call that singing?
Detachment, halt!
So... we have no spirit, huh?
We are in no mood for recreation.
Work is what we want.
Good! Then we'll go back to work!
Detachment, lie down!
Keep your head down!
Now sing!
Men... halt!
Order, arms!
Inspection at 3:00.
Dismissed!
Oh, that swine!
That means we get no time off.
It will take four hours to get ready for inspection.
- I'd like to know what's in his mind.
- He hasn't got any!
I'm gonna cut him open sometime and find out!
He's too thick-skinned.
He won't cut.
This is the fourth time he's made me disappoint that poor girl.
Arms!
Order, arms!
Left shoulder, arms!
Squad right.
To the right, march!
Left, left, left, left.
Follow right, march!
Squad, left march!
Forward... march!
Detachment... halt!
Present arms!
Himmelstoss.
Excellent work.
They're going up front tomorrow.
- I recommend leave till midnight.
- Very good, sir.
Detachment...
Crawl forward!
He spoiled our leave.
I'll never forgive him for that.
- The rat!
- Leave till midnight.
Hmm! It'll take till midnight to dry our clothes.
There goes the filthy ape now.
While we slave over this mud, he goes off to have a few drinks!
Someday I'm going to take one smack at him-- just one.
Me too.
That's gonna be my life's work from now on.
Why only one?
I'm gonna take several.
I might even kick him while he's down.
I feel mean.
What are you doing?
You're not going to desert, are you?
What?
Listen. I've got an idea.
Crawl forward!
Lie down!
Lie down! Crawl forward!
- Cover!
- Paul, you all right?
Behn! Behn!
Come on! Behn, come on!
You fool!
Behn!
Get up! Come on.
- Sounds like more replacements coming in.
Yeah.
Tjaden must have gone home for that wood.
There's some more, fresh from the turnip patch.
I suppose this is where we bunk.
That's me, "l. Westhus,"
and this is where I live.
- I didn't know!
- Well, you know now!
Yes. Yes, of course.
- It's all right.
- Here's a bunk, Paul.
- When did we eat last?
- Don't remind me.
- I was fine until you spoke. - Where are we anyway?
I don't know.
The name on the railroad station's been shot off.
There must be something to eat somewhere.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll ask those fellas.
Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Westhus.
Oh. Meet Detering.
A better farmer never lived.
- And Mr. Tjaden.
- Sit down.
You see, we haven't eaten since breakfast.
We thought maybe you could tell us what we ought to do about it.
Eat without further delay.
Well, what's funny about that?
This is a bad town to bring an appetite to, soldier.
We've been here since yesterday morning, living on baled hay and razor blades.
We're willing to buy our food.
Where's the canteen?
The only canteen in these regions is out looking for supplies.
- Ever hear of Katczinsky?
- Who?
Katczinsky.
He's uncanny.
If there's any food within 25 miles, he'll be the one to get it.
Attention!
- What is this?
- Volunteers for the future generals' staff.
Sometime I'm gonna take one of you volunteers apart... and find out what makes you leave school and join the army.
At ease.
This is no parade ground.
- Hungry? - Yes.
Wait! Wait a minute!
That's no invitation.
Can you pay?
I have some money.
No, not money.
That's just pieces of paper.
Have you got any cigarettes, cigars, - or soap, cognac-- - Yeah, yeah.
Are you crazy?
There ain't enough here for us.
I wish you three would get bumped off.
I'm tired of feeding ya for nothing.
- Bring everything you got.
- I'd be glad to give you-- - Come on!
- Is this enough, sir?
- Kat! - Hmm? - You've got the wiring detail tonight.
- Where? - Past the graveyard.
- With this bunch?
It's quiet tonight.
You can teach 'em a couple of things.
Thanks.
I'd rather do it alone.
- These babes get killed off too fast.
- Well, the lorry's waiting.
Last night I was too hungry to sleep, and tonight, when I get the wrinkles out of my gut, they think up wiring duty.
Well, here's your chance, heroes.
For the fatherland!
Come on, get your stuff and let's get out of here.
- Is that any way to drive?
- Let him drive any way he wants.
Suppose he breaks your arm.
You get sent home, don't you?
A lot better than havin' a hole in your guts.
If there's any of you left, I'll pick you up in the morning.
Well, if that ride you gave us didn't kill us, nothing will.
- And be on time.
I don't want to miss my breakfast.
- You better wait for your army, Papa.
Here, here. Don't be so backward.
Listen, children. All we got to do is to string a little wire.
We pick it up at the dump and carry it to where we need it.
Now, you're gonna see some shell fire, and you're gonna be scared, see?
It's all right, boy.
Get up.
Here.
Never mind.
It's happened to better men than you, and it's happened to me.
When we come back, I'll get you all some nice clean underwear.
That kind of shell you don't have to pay much attention to.
Those big fellas just make a lot of noise and land about five miles behind the line.
The things we've got to watch out for are the light ones.
They don't give you much warning.
They go "waa-aa-aah zing."
And when you hear that, down!
Mother Earth.
Press yourselves down upon her.
Bury yourselves deep into her.
Just keep your eyes on me.
When you see me flop, you flop, only try to beat me to it.
Now listen.
I'll show you how it's done.
Give me a couple of those.
That's to kill the noise.
Tjaden.
See that?
- What's that mean?
- Bombardment.
My eyes!
I'm blind!
I can't see!
God!
- My eyes!
I can't see!
- I can't see! - It's Behn!
It's Behn!
- I'll go get him--
- You'll get killed!
- Let me--
- Lay down and stay there!
He's dead.
- Why did you risk your life bringing' him in?
But it's Behn!
- My friend.
- He's a corpse, no matter who it is.
Now, don't any of you ever do that again.
Put him over there.
- Mind the wire.
All right, come on. Get your packs and fall in.
Hurry up!
Come on. Hurry up.
Get your packs and fall in.
Kat, what are we doing?
What's happening?
You heard him.
Orders to march.
- But where to, for the love of -- - Another party.
And this one is gonna last a long time.
Come on.
Here we go.
Company, attention!
Shoulder arms!
March right, march!
- Take your hands off that!
- Queen takes it!
- Well, if you think that's a queen, look again.
Ah, it's a jack.
- Yeah. - Honest, these cards all look alike.
It's too noisy!
I can't play.
- I suppose your delicate nerves can't stand it.
That's Oscar.
The son of a--
Look at that!
Don't be so snooty.
You may wish you had this back.
About two more days of this... and this rat-bitten end of a piece of bread's gonna taste like a hunk of fruitcake.
It wouldn't- - It wouldn't last two more days, would it?
Didn't I tell you this was gonna be a bad one?
I don't mind the days so much. It's keeping up all night--
Ah, two more days makes a week, kid.
Then you can say you've been under fire!
You're not scared, are you?
No.
I was just asking.
- Wanna play some more?
- Do you?
- Sure.
- All right. My deal.
You better get your boot back before Oscar eats that!
- The kid's all right.
Yeah, yeah.
Let him sleep. He's dreamin'.
Oh, God.
Can't you see it's Behn?
He didn't want to come to war!
No, no. It isn't Behn.
It isn't Behn!
It's Kemmerick! It's me!
Shut up, will you?
It's bad enough in here as it is. Every--
Everything's all right, Franz.
You're dreaming.
You're just dreaming, I guess.
- Attention!
- At ease.
The barrage is gettin' worse.
The men in two more dugouts gone.
However, we'll do our best to get some food up here by evening.
Stop! Stop!
Let me out!
- What did you do that for?
- Shut up!
Grab him.
- Now hold him.
You all right now?
I think so.
I couldn't hold out much longer.
- Oh, God, it's Franz!
- Get him over there!
No, he's been hit in the stomach.
He can't have anything to drink.
Get a stretcher.
Where'd they get you, Kemmerick?
- Here it is, sir.
- Take his head.
All right. Take him out.
- Is it serious, sir?
- I'm not sure.
- Tell the others he's all right.
- Yes, sir.
If we're going to fight, why don't we fight?
Why don't we go over?
You could go crazy staying here.
Let's do something!
- Let's go after 'em!
- Sit down!
If that cook of ours had any guts, he'd try to bring something through.
He's so far behind the lines he can't hear the shooting!
- Here's Kat.
Get anything?
- Any luck?
- We'll have to split this up among us.
- Something to eat!
We need butter too.
Yes.
And dessert.
And a feather bed to sleep on.
- Rats!
Get out of the way!
What's that?
- Come on!
Grab your rifles!
- Here they come.
- Get your grenades here.
Hurry up.
Come on, hurry up.
Let's go!
Back to your own lines!
- Fill it up.
- And hurry up.
I've got other things to do.
I've been waiting for this for three weeks.
When they all get here.
What do you want?
Beans, you homely-lookin' son of a frog's leg. - What do you think I want?
I'll feed you when you're all here.
- We're all here now.
- Only half the company's here.
Get the rest.
- Wake 'em up.
I wish I could wake 'em up.
There's 80 of us left.
The rest is in dressing stations or pushing' up daisies.
Eighty?
And I cooked for 150!
All right. We'll have enough for once.
Come on. Dish out!
You mean you've cooked beans for 150... and you've got bread for 150... and sausage for 150, and tobacco for 150?
Everything!
It's all wrong.
I should have been notified.
What a feast!
- Everyone gets two issues.
- Get back in line!
Get back in line! - Oh, no! That won't do.
I can't give 80 men what's meant for 150.
Listen. You drew rations for the 2nd Company, didn't ya?
Yeah.
All right. We're the 2nd Company.
- I've got my orders.
- Kat's right.
- We're the 2nd Company.
And if only half of us get back, that's our good luck.
- Come on. Dish it out. - Come on!
- No!
You're the yellowest baboon that ever drew a cook wagon, and you're scared-- it shows.
All we want to hear out of you is one more little yip, and we'll cut ya up and eat ya raw.
Why, you keep your kitchen so far back of the lines, we never get anything to eat until it's cold and we're asleep!
Now, you low-down rat, get out... - or we wreck the joint!
- Come on! Give us-- - Attention!
At ease.
What's goin' on here?
He's cooked for 150, sir, and he only wants to give us half.
- Looks pretty good.
- Yes, sir.
- Serve the whole issue.
The men can use it.
- Yes, sir.
- And bring me a plate too.
- Yes, sir. All right. Take it all.
Take everything.
Give 'em honey.
Give 'em what they want.
- Fill it up!
-Don't mind me. -Oh, that's all right.
Don't mention it.
You know...
I could do with some more beans.
Go help yourself.
There's more over there.
- It's too far.
- I wonder, when are we going back to the front?
It's enough to take away a man's appetite.
You know, if they're gonna march us in again tomorrow, we ought to go see how Kemmerick is. - That's a good idea.
- Let's do that.
- How far is the dressing station?
- About two miles. - We could take his things to him.
- Good.
It seemed rotten to think of a thing like that happening to him, a nice fellow like Kemmerick.
Ah, the French certainly deserve to be punished for starting this war.
Everybody says it's somebody else.
Well, how do they start a war?
Well, one country offends another.
How could one country offend another?
You mean there's a mountain over in Germany gets mad at a field over in France?
- Well, stupid, one people offends another.
Oh, if that's it, I shouldn't be here at all.
I don't feel offended.
It don't apply to tramps like you.
Good. Then I can be going home right away.
- Ah, you just try it.
- Yeah. You wanna get shot?
- The kaiser and me--
Me and the kaiser felt just alike about this war.
We didn't either of us want any war, so I'm going home.
- He's there already.
- Somebody must have wanted it.
Maybe it was the English.
No, I don't want to shoot any Englishmen.
I never saw one till I came up here.
And I suppose most of them never saw a German till they came up here.
- No, I'm sure they weren't asked about it.
- No. Well... it must be doing somebody some good.
- Not me and the kaiser.
- I think maybe the kaiser wanted a war.
You leave us out of this!
I don't see that.
The kaiser's got everything he needs.
Well, he never had a war before.
Every full-grown emperor needs one war to make him famous.
- Why, that's history. - Yeah, generals too. They need war.
- And manufacturers. They get rich.
I think it's more a kind of fever.
Nobody wants it in particular, and then all at once, there it is.
We didn't want it.
The English didn't want it.
And here we are fighting.
I'll tell you how it should all be done.
Whenever there's a big war comin' on, - you should rope off a big field--
- And sell tickets. Yeah.
And--
And on the big day, you should take all the kings and their cabinets and their generals, put them in the center dressed in their underpants, and let 'em fight it out with clubs.
The best country wins.
Well, now that Kat's settled everything, let's go see Kemmerick.
- Something interesting might happen on the way.
- Might cheer him up. Boys, me and the kaiser want you back in time to march tomorrow.
Don't forget.
- We'll be back. - Give the boy my regards.
There he is.
- Hello, Kemmerick.
- How's it going?
How are things going?
Are they looking after you all right?
How are they treating you?
They're robbers here.
Robbers.
They stole my watch!
I always told you, nobody should carry as good a watch as that.
- They took it while I was under ether!
- Franz, you'll get it back.
Do you feel all right?
- Just look at my hand.
- That's because you lost so much blood.
- Just eat decently and you'll get well again.
- Oh, no. You must eat.
That's the main thing.
It looks good too.
I have such a terrible pain in my foot.
Every toe on my right foot hurts.
Well, how can your foot hurt when your leg's been--
I know what you mean!
I know! I know now!
They cut my leg off.
Why didn't they tell me?
- Why didn't they tell me?
- Franz!
Franz! - Now I can't walk anymore!
You must be thankful that you've come off with only that.
I wanted to be a forester once.
You can yet.
They make artificial legs that are wonderful.
And you're through too.
You can go home.
Think of that.
We brought your things for you.
See? Put 'em under the bed.
That's a marvelous pair of boots.
Look at that leather!
What comfort.
I was just thinking.
If you're not going to be using these, Franz, why don't you leave 'em with us?
What good are they to you?
I can use 'em.
My boots give me blister after blister--
Well, we'll be going, Franz.
Oh, don't go.
Stay just a little while longer.
- I'll come right back.
- We'll be coming soon again, Franz.
- I know you'll be feeling better.
- Bye. - Bye.
- Good-bye, Franz.
You think he'll last till after mess?
- I don't think--
- Done for.
Boys, you go along.
I'll see you later.
Good-bye.
All right, Paul.
I'm sorry, Paul.
I wouldn't touch a thing of his if he could use it.
I'd go barefoot over barbed wire for him if it'd do him any good.
Only- - Only why should some orderly get those boots?
I understand, Mueller.
We're all alike out here.
And good boots are scarce.
Tell the doctor to come, please.
Doctor, the man in the next bed would like to see you, sir.
I've done everything I can for him.
There's no helping him.
Poor little fella.
He says next time, Franz.
Do you think I'll ever get well?
Why, of course.
- Do you really think so?
- Sure, once you get over the operation.
I don't think so.
Franz!
Don't talk nonsense.
Why, you'll be as good as new.
They fix up worse things than that.
Perhaps you'll go to the convalescent home... in Klosterberg among the villagers.
Then you can look out of the windows, across the fields... to the two trees on the horizon.
The loveliest time of the year now when the corn ripens.
You can go out without asking anyone.
You can even play piano if you want to.
Oh- - Oh, but, Franz, you must try to sleep now.
O God, this is Franz Kemmerick, only 19 years old.
He doesn't want to die.
Please don't let him die.
Take my boots home for Mueller.
Oh, no, Franz, no.
And if... Paul... you find my watch, send it home.
Doctor.
Doctor! Where's the doctor?
Why isn't there a doctor here?
- Doctor, come quick. Franz Kemmerick is dying!
- Which one is that?
- Amputated leg. - I've amputated a dozen legs today.
- Bed 26, sir.
- You see to it.
I'm due in the operating room.
One operation after another since 5:00 this morning.
Sixteen dead today, and yours is the 17th.
There'll probably be 20 by the morning.
What's your hurry?
Hey! I'll bet he stole those boots!
- I got it, Kat. - Hmm?
Listen: "The sum of an arithmetic series... is S = A + L x N over 2."
- lnteresting, isn't it?
- What do you wanna learn that stuff for?
One day you'll stop a bullet and it'll all be worthless.
- I get a lot of fun out of it.
My boots!
Mueller.
I saw him die.
I didn't know what it was like to die before.
And then-- then I came outside... and it felt-- it felt so good to be alive that I started in to walk fast.
I began to think of the strangest things, like being out in the fields.
Things like that.
You know-- girls.
And it felt as if there were... something electric running from the ground up through me.
And I started.
I began to run hard.
I passed soldiers and I heard voices calling to me.
I ran and I ran.
I felt as if I couldn't breathe enough air into me.
And-- And now I'm hungry.
I don't mind the war now.
Be a pleasure to go to the front in boots like these.
It's a good invention just the same.
If you crack each separate louse, think of all the energy you use up. Watch.
Burned to death.
- How was patrol? Bad?
- Must've been terrible if they had time to gather the harvest.
We passed a cherry tree and when he saw it, he went crazy.
I could hardly drag him away.
It was... beautiful.
I have a big orchard with cherry trees at home.
When they're in full blossom, from the hayloft it looks like one single sheet.
So white.
- Perhaps you can get leave soon.
- You may even be sent back as a farmer.
A woman can't run a farm alone. That's no good, you know?
No matter how hard she works.
Harvest coming on again.
What's the matter with him?
Got a letter yesterday from his wife.
He wants to get back to his farm.
We'd all like to get back home.
I wonder what we'd do if it were suddenly peacetime again?
Get drunk and look for women!
I'd go looking for a Cinderella... that could wear this for a garter.
And when I'd found her, nobody'd see me for two weeks.
I'll go back to the peat fields... and those pleasant hours in the beer gardens.
And there's worse things than cobbling too.
Look.
My family.
I oughta give you a kick in the backside for startin' all this.
It's all right for all you to talk.
You've got something to go back to:
wives, children, jobs.
But what about us? What have we got to go back to?
- School?
- Why not?
You know everything already.
A man can't take all that rubbish they teach you seriously... after three years of shells and bombs.
- You can't peel that off easily.
- They never taught us anything really useful, like how to light a cigarette in the wind or make a fire out of wet wood... or bayonet a man in the belly instead of the ribs where it gets jammed.
What can happen to us afterwards?
I'll tell ya.
Take our class.
Out of 20, three are officers, nine dead,
Mueller and three others wounded... and one in the madhouse.
We'll all be dead someday, so let's forget it.
Hurry up! Get in there!
Hurry up!
Himmelstoss!
What's up?
- What are you, crazy?
- It's Himmelstoss! Himmelstoss?
There is justice in the army!
Well, well.
So, we are all here, huh?
-A bit longer than you, Himmie.
-Since when have we become so familiar?
Stand up and click your heels together! All of you!
- Take a running jump at yourself!
- Who's your friend?
Would somebody get General Ludendorff a nice, comfortable chair?
I command you as your superior officer!
- Do you want to be court-martialed?
- I do! There's going to be a big attack tonight and I'd just love to get out of it.
Will you obey my orders?
Kiss my butt!
It isn't customary to ask for salutes here. But I'll tell you what we'll do.
We're going to attack a town that we tried to take once before.
Many killed and many wounded.
It was great fun.
This time you're going with us.
If any of us stops a bullet, before we die... we're going to come to you, click our heels together and ask stiffly,
- "Please, Sergeant Himmelstoss, may we go?"
- You'll--
You'll pay for this, you--
There it is.
Better get ready, boys.
I'm wounded!
I'm wounded!
It's just a scratch, you yellow rat! Up!
Get out with the others!
- Up! - No!
No! No!
You yellow rat!
Stinking yellow rat!
Let the others do it, eh?
Get up! Get up!
- Aa-aah!
- Get up! Forward!
- Get out here!
- Command... was forward.
Forward!
Counterattack.
I want to help you.
Stop it, stop it.
I can bear the rest of it.
I can't listen to that!
Why do you take so long dying?
You're going to die anyway!
Oh, no. You won't die. Oh, no.
You won't die.
They're only little wounds. You'll get home.
You'll be all right.
You'll get home long before I will.
You know I can't run away. That's why you accuse me.
I tell you, I didn't want to kill you.
I tried to keep you alive.
If you jumped in here again, I wouldn't do it.
When you jumped in here you were my enemy, and I was afraid of you.
But you're just a man like me, and I killed you.
Forgive me, comrade.
Say that for me.
Say you forgive me.
Oh, no.
You're dead.
You're better off than I am.
You're through.
They can't do any more to you now.
Oh, God, why did they do this to us?
We only wanted to live, you and I.
Why should they send us out to fight each other?
If we threw away these rifles and these uniforms, you could be my brother just like Kat and Albert.
You'll have to forgive me, comrade.
I'll do all I can.
I'll write to your parents. I'll write to--
I'll write to your wife.
I'll write to her.
I promise she'll not want for anything.
I'll help her and your parents too.
Only forgive me.
Forgive me!
Terrible thing happened yesterday.
I stabbed a man.
With my own hands, stabbed him.
I know how it is.
Your first time.
Never mind.
The stretcher-bearers will find him.
- He's dead.
I watched him die.
- You couldn't do anything about it.
We have to kill.
We can't help it.
That's what we are here for.
Uh- - Look there, for instance.
That got him.
You should've seen how he leaped in the air.
That fellow had to shoot with us for today with three hits.
If he keeps it up, he'll have a decoration for his buttonhole this evening.
Don't you lose any more sleep over this business.
Maybe it was 'cause I was out there with him so long, huh?
Sure, that's it.
After all, war is war.
Forward, march!
Quick there!
Forward!
Company... halt!
Dismissed!
Uncommissioned officers, enlisted men, dismiss!
- Give me your best sausage.
- Two.
Give me a beer.
One, two, three!
Hey, come on.
A beer.
Hey, get out of here!
Come on. Give me a beer.
A beer.
One b--
Here's hoping we get falling-down drunk tonight.
Here's how it started.
I'd forgotten there were girls like that.
There aren't.
Just look at those thin, little shoes.
She couldn't march many miles in those.
Paul!
Don't speak about marching.
You're boring the young lady.
A thousand pardons.
- How old do you think she is?
- Oh, about 22.
No, that'd make her older than us.
She's... 17.
A girl like that.
That'd be good, eh, Albert?
We wouldn't have much of a chance with him around.
- We could take a bath, wash our clothes--
- All right.
and I might even go so far as to get deloused.
Wait a minute!
She's a long way from here now.
Look at the date.
May, 1917.
- Four months ago.
- That's true.
Well, here's to her anyway.
Here's to 'em all, everywhere.
Albert, - we might as well wash up anyway.
- All right.
Personally, I like 'em bigger around.
This conversation was on a high moral plane up to now.
Now we do need a bath.
- A bath?
- For what?
You wouldn't understand.
This water is freezing.
This romantic business has gone too far.
- Ahh, but think of her beautiful eyes! - Oh!
Oh, and her hair.
- Here we are!
- We're not gonna miss a thing!
- What are you doing here?
- Bathing!
They tell me there's some people in this world takes a bath every week!
Women!
Mademoiselle, you want to swim?
Aw, baby!
Aw, no, girls! Don't go away!
- Please don't go!
Food! Whoo-hoo!
Halt!
You know you're forbidden to cross.
You fellows stay on this side or you'll get yourselves in a lot of trouble.
- What are they jabbering' about? - They want us to swing over tonight.
They're expecting us. - That's fine!
- That blonde's crazy about me.
- But there's four of us and only three of them.
- I was the one that stopped 'em!
That blonde piece of work is mine.
You three fight for what's left.
Fight's the word.
All's fair in love and war.
Huh? What do you mean?
What're you gonna do?
You'll find out.
- C'est moi, blondie!
She means the door.
Not only modest, but dashing!
A perfect fit.
It might've been made for me. An officer's coat.
We're calling distinguished company.
Have another little drink, comrade.
Is this your birthday or mine?
Why?
You've been buying me drink after drink for two hours.
What I'm tryin' to figure out is why.
Why?
Oh. I-It's just that the boys... told me to amuse you for a little while.
Oh, nice boys.
Yeah!
They-They said you'd understand.
I've been betrayed!
Yeah, you certainly have.
Take that for a minute!
I'll give you more!
It's too loud.
Suzanne. And I wouldn't even know you if I did.
And yet, I'll remember you always.
Oh, if you could only know how different this is from the women we soldiers meet.
You.
That's what I'm talking about.
It seems as though all war and terror and grossness... had fallen away from me... like a miracle.
Like something I never believed.
Frau Paul.
We're going, Paul.
Have a look.
Nice, new coffins.
Huh! For us.
I must say, that's a very cheerful preparation for this offensive.
That's very considerate of them. But I don't see any long enough for our comrade Tjaden.
Mind you, I'm not speaking to you, you traitors.
- But no coffin's gonna get me.
- I should say not, heartbreaker.
You'll be thankful if they slip a waterproof sheet... - around that Aunt Sally of a carcass of yours.
Oh-Oh, my side!
Catholic hospital, Albert.
They say you always get good food and good treatment.
- We're lucky.
- After that rainy dressing station... and 24 hours on the train, we deserve to have some luck.
I'm Hamacher.
Yeah, that's my name.
I got a crack in the head and they gave me a certificate stating, "Josef Hamacher is periodically... not responsible for his actions."
And ever since then, Hamacher has been having a grand time.
I hope you boys are not too badly wounded.
The others die off so quickly we don't have time to get acquainted.
You'll get to know us... very well.
Thank you.
You too.
I'm sorry, my dear.
It's time to go now.
Yes, sister.
Watch.
If they take his clothes away, you've seen the last of him.
- See? They're taking him to the dying room.
- Dying room?
When you're ready to kick the bucket, they get you out of the way so they can use the bed.
In the corner of the building there's a little room... right next to the morgue!
It's so convenient. It saves a lot of trouble.
But suppose he gets well?
I've seen a lot of 'em go in that dying room, but nobody ever comes back.
Sister.
- Is that you ringing, Paul?
- Yes.
- Is something going on?
- I think I have a hemorrhage.
The bandage is all wet.
I've been ringing forever and nobody comes.
- I think I'm bleeding.
- Sister, get me a sterile dressing and an ice pack.
- Why didn't someone call me?
- He's been ringing.
Nobody can walk, Sister.
- Sister, is it bad? - No. No, we'll be all right.
We've got it in time.
What's the matter?
What are you doing?
We must rearrange your bandages.
- Where are you taking me?
To the bandaging ward.
- No, no!
I'm not going!
I'm staying here! - Paul! Paul!
- Now, now!
- I'm not going to the dying room!
- We're going to the bandaging ward.
- Why are you taking my clothes?
You're lying to me!
But I'll come back.
I won't die!
I'll come back!
I won't die!
Sister Libertine, how is he?
Poor boy.
They had to amputate his leg.
Oh, he is... gone.
Hello.
Welcome home, Albert!
- How do you feel, kid?
- All right. But I've got such an awful pain.
My foot hur --
Hamacher. Did they cut my leg off?
Of course not!
How many did you have?
Two?
You still got 'em!
One, two!
Don't play the fool, Hamacher.
Tell me truthfully.
Of course not.
And you look fine.
Look.
See?
- I won't be a cripple. - Now, now.
- I won't live like that!
- Be calm. - I'll kill myself the first chance I get!
- Albert! - I won't live!
I won't live! - Yes, you will.
Albert, I've come back!
I told you I'd come back.
Look, everybody! I've come back!
- Paul! Paul!
- That's not where I'm going.
I live over there.
Paul, I'm so happy.
Hamacher, I've come back from the dead!
- It's most irregular.
- Albert, get well quickly... so we can go home soon.
- Everything will be all right now.
- Yes, Paul. Everything will be all right... now.
Oh! Paul! Paul!
Paul. - What's the matter, Paul?
- Nothing.
Paul. Give me your handkerchief.
- Mother?
- Here I am, Paul. Here I am.
Mother's ill.
- Are you wounded?
- No, Mother.
I got leave.
Here I am cryin' instead of being glad.
Anna, get down the jar of blackberries.
You still like them, don't you?
Yes, Mother.
I haven't had any for a long time.
We might almost have known you were coming.
- I'm making potato cakes.
- Don't let them burn.
Paul... sit down... beside me.
My Paul.
My baby.
I almost forgot, Mother.
I've got some little presents for you.
Look, Mother.
Bread, sausage and rice.
- Paul, you've been starving yourself. - Hmm-mm.
Hadn't I better go and tell Father Paul's home?
- Paul could watch the things on the stove.
- No, I'm getting up.
Oh, Paul, you're a soldier now, aren't you?
But somehow, I don't seem to know you.
I'll take these off, Mother.
I'll get your suit.
It's in the wardrobe, just where you left it.
Are you really here, Paul?
You won't--
You won't disappear, will you?
No. I'm here.
Your things are ready for you, Paul.
- I remember when you caught that one. - Yes.
And you took it away from me, didn't you?
Yes, I did.
We're behind the lines, but we know how to honor the soldier... who goes on in spite of blood and death.
Gentlemen, my son.
I'm glad to know you, young man, I am glad to know you.
How are things out there?
Terrible, eh? Terrible.
But we must carry on.
After all, you do at least get decent food out there.
Naturally, it's worse here. Naturally.
But the best for our soldiers all the time.
That's our motto.
The best for our soldiers.
But... - you must give the Frenchies a good licking!
And, if you boys want to come home, ehh, let me show you what you must do before you can come home.
Give us a hand there, men.
Now, then, there's the line.
Runs so, in a "V".
Here is St. Quentin.
You can see for yourself.
You're almost through now.
All right?
Shove ahead out there and don't stick to that everlasting French warfare!
Smash through the johnnies!
And then you will have peace.
When you get in it... the war isn't the way it looks back here.
Oh! You don't know anything about it.
Of course, you know about the details, but this relates to the whole!
You can't judge that.
Of course, you do your duty and you risk your life.
But for that, you receive the highest honor.
I said that every man in the war ought to have the lron Cross.
First, the enemy lines must be broken through in Flanders.
- On to Paris!
Push on to Paris!
- Right.
No, not in Flanders.
I'll tell you just where the break should come.
- Here.
- The enemy has too many reserves there.
- I insist upon Flanders!
- Why should they do that... when they're halfway through St. Quentin already?
Because Flanders is a flat country!
- No mountains, no obstructions!
- There's too many rivers there!
From the farms they have gone; from the schools, from the factories.
They have gone bravely, nobly, ever forward, realizing there is no other duty now but to save the fatherland. Paul!
How are you, Paul?
Glad to see you, Professor.
You've come at the right moment, Baumer!
Just at the right moment.
And as if to prove all I have said, here is one of the first to go.
A lad who sat before me on these very benches... who gave up all to serve in the first year of the war;
one of the iron youth who have made Germany invincible in the field.
Look at him-- sturdy and bronze and clear -eyed.
The kind of soldier every one of you should envy.
Oh, lad, you must speak to them.
You must tell them what it means to serve your fatherland.
- No, I can't tell them anything.
- You must, Paul.
Just a word.
Just tell them how much they're needed out there.
Tell them why you went and what it meant to you.
I can't say anything.
You can remember some deed of heroism, some touch of nobility. Tell about it.
I can't tell you anything you don't know.
We live in the trenches out there.
We fight.
We try not to be killed;
sometimes we are.
That's all.
No.
No, Paul.
I've been there!
I know what it's like.
That's not what one dwells on, Paul.
I heard you in here reciting that same old stuff, making more iron men, more young heroes.
You still think it's beautiful and sweet to die for your country, don't you?
We used to think you knew.
The first bombardment taught us better.
It's dirty and painful to die for your country.
When it comes to dying for your country, it's better not to die at all!
There are millions out there dying for their countries, and what good is it?
You asked me to tell them how much they're needed out there.
He tells you, "Go out and die."
Oh, but if you'll pardon me, it's easier to say "Go out and die" than it is to do it.
- Coward!
- And it's easier to say it than to watch it happen.
No!
Boys, boys!
- I'm sorry, Baumer, but I must say--
- It's no use talking like this.
You won't know what I mean.
Only, it's been a long while since we enlisted out of this classroom.
So long I thought maybe the whole world had learned by this time.
Only now they're sending babies, and they won't last a week!
I shouldn't have come on leave.
Up at the front you're alive or you're dead, and that's all!
You can't fool anybody about that very long.
Up there we know we're lost and done for whether we're dead or alive.
Three years we've had of it-- four years.
Every day a year and every night a century.
Our bodies are earth and our thoughts are clay, and we sleep and eat with death.
We're done for because you can't live that way and keep anything inside you!
I shouldn't have come on leave.
I'll go back tomorrow.
I've got four days more, but I can't stand it here!
I'll go back tomorrow!
Sorry.
Mother, you'll catch cold here.
You must go to sleep.
There'll be plenty of time to sleep... when you're gone.
Must you go tomorrow, Paul?
Must you? Yes, Mother.
Orders were changed.
Are you very much afraid, Paul?
No, Mother.
There's something I want to say to you, Paul.
It's-- Just be on your guard against the women out there.
They're no good.
Where we are, there aren't any women, Mother.
Be very careful at the front, Paul.
Yes, Mother, I will.
I'll pray for you every day.
And if you could, get a job that's not quite so dangerous.
Yes, Mother.
I'll try and get in the cookhouse.
- That can easily be done.
- You do it then, and if the others say anything--
That won't worry me, Mother.
Now, you must go to bed and you must get well quickly before I come back.
I put two sets of underwear -- new ones-- in your pack.
They'll keep you nice and warm.
They're all wool.
That's sweet of you.
Good night...
Good night, Mother.
Oh, Mother, Mother.
You still think I'm a child.
Why can't I put my head in your lap and cry?
- Is this the 2nd Company?
- Is this all of it?
- Yes, sir.
We had 150 men, but this is all that came back yesterday.
But now they're going to give us enough to make 150 again.
How old are you?
Sixteen.
No use.
I couldn't find anything.
- We'll have to eat the sawdust.
Not me!
I'll go hungry first. It makes me sick.
Now it's gonna be a real war again.
Paul!
How's old Paul?
Here I am.
You know, the 2nd Company's getting hard to find.
Nobody seemed to know where you were.
I'm glad you found it.
I guess I don't get much of this.
There used to be some food in the sawdust.
Now it's all sawdust.
No joke, either.
Eats ya up inside.
This doesn't look much like the old 2nd Company.
The replacements are all like that.
Not even old enough to carry a pack.
All they know how to do is die.
I guess... some of the old-timers are here yet.
Paul, they're tryin' to invent somethin' to kill me right now.
Where's Westhus?
Messenger dog was wounded.
He went out to get it. - Is it true about the armistice?
- Doesn't look that way back there.
- You mean they want us to go on fighting?
- That's what they say.
They're crazy!
Germany'll be empty pretty soon.
Where is-- Where is Detering?
He got homesick.
You remember about the cherry blossoms?
I guess he never got over that.
He started out one night to go home and help his wife with the farm.
They got him behind the lines, and we never heard of him since.
He was just homesick, but probably they couldn't see it that way.
Where's Kat?
Is he--
Not Kat!
If he were out, the war would be over.
You remember what he always says:
They're savin' him for the last.
- Where is he?
- He's out lookin' for food, something to make soup with.
-Which way?
-Down the road about two miles that way.
I'll see you later.
Kat!
Paul!
Hello, Paul.
- How's the side? - Oh, it's all right now.
It's fine.
- Have any luck?
- No, the general's staff's been over this country with a rake.
Let's sit down there.
Tell me, Paul... how was it at home?
Have a good leave?
- In spots.
- What's the matter?
Ohh... I'm no good for back there anymore, Kat.
None of us are.
We've been in this too long.
The young men thought I was a coward because I told them that... we learn that death is stronger than duty to one's country.
The old men said, "Go on.
Push on to Paris."
My father even wanted me to wear my uniform around him.
It's not home back there anymore.
All I could think of was, "I'd like to get back and see Kat again."
You're all I've got left, Kat.
I'm not much to have left.
I missed you, Paul.
At least we know what it's all about out here.
There're no lies here. Push on to Paris?
You ought to see what they've got on the other side.
They eat white bread over there.
They've got dozens of airplanes to our one, and tanks that'll go over anything.
What've we got left?
Guns so worn they drop shells on our own men.
No food, no ammunition, no officers.
Push on to Paris!
So that's the way they talk back there.
I guess we'd better be going.
How I lied to my poor mother.
I told her it wasn't so bad out here because there was always a lot of us together.
Now that I'm with you, I'm beginning to believe that I told her the truth.
Down!
That's another one that missed us.
Come on.
Let's go. Wait a minute.
Looks like the old bread wagon's broke down.
- I guess I don't walk the rest of the way.
- Did that get ya, Kat?
Aah, I think it broke my shin.
That's not so bad.
Hold it together.
- Just my luck, huh?
- Good luck.
That means the war is over.
Oh, no, sir!
This war don't end till they really get me.
Now this one-- - Aah. - Easy, now.
- Hey!
Easy! Come on.
I'll take you in.
Give me your hand.
Easy.
Well, kid... now we're gonna be separated.
Maybe we can do something together later on when the war is over.
- Yes, kid.
- You give me your address, I'll give you mine.
You can't get both of us in one day.
Ah, we'll surely see each other again, Kat.
Remember that day when you brought the whole pig into the factory?
And that day in the woods when you taught us how to dodge shells?
And my first bombardment.
How I cried.
I was a young recruit then.
Here we are.
All right now, Kat.
You could've spared yourself the trouble.
He's dead.
Oh, no. He's just fainted.
He was hit in the shin.
He's dead.
Would you like to take his pay book?
- You're not related, are you?
- No, we're not related.
Your deal.
Get his name and number?
Yeah, Corporal Stanislaus Katczinsky, 306.
Extra! Read all about it!
Again a fresh election!
Read all about it!
Extra!
Apples.
Apples.
Where do you think you're going?
What do you mean...?
Shut up, you pasty-faced palookas.
Apples, apples.
Apples.
Hey, Annie!
Come round to the house sometime.
I got a lot of silverware hanging around loose.
Apples.
Hello, Schultzie, how's business?
Not so good over at the Apollo.
Go over to the Casino.
They got a hit over there.
Is that so?
I'll go right over.
Thanks.
Yeah.
If you changed your tune, perhaps you'd have better luck.
The Dude wants to see you, Annie.
He's over at Missouri Martin's.
Yeah, I know.
How's pickings, Smiley?
Terrible. Everybody's broke.
Must be tough on them.
Stop yappin'.
Didn't you hear the President over the radio?
Get on over to the Casino.
They've got a hit over there.
- They have?
- Sure. Spread it around.
Don't forget Missouri Martin's.
Dude said it was important.
Alright, I won't.
Apples.
Apples.
Okay, girls.
What's going on?
- What's the mystery?
- Babe, Dude's got a big bet on.
- Yeah, what kind of bet?
- You're liable to scare the fly.
What fly?
Dude bet the Greek the fly would land on his piece of sugar first.
- What do you say, Dude?
500 more?
- You're on.
What do you think you're doing, Shakespeare?
I'm decoying him, Dude, over to your lump.
Tough luck, Dude.
That's 1500 you owe me.
I bet the Greek's got them flies trained.
Now that the animal act's over, let's get going.
- Yeah, we better get going.
- Let's blow.
Hey, Dude, I give you a chance to get even.
- Nothing doing.
- Alright.
This is a lot of hokum, playing around with flies when a real sucker's waiting for us, with real dough.
What's the matter, handsome?
I should have know better than to bet without my apple.
I'm going to find Apple Annie.
You're searching for her now?
Listen, Happy. This is one of the biggest stud games l've sat in.
I'm not taking any chances.
Look what just happened to me.
I even lost to the Greek.
Did I tell you about the fella, superstitious about a hunchback?
He went looking for him one day and got run over by a truck.
A fella told me it was hard luck to be superstitious.
- Go out and find Apple Annie.
- Okay, Dude.
I'm on my way.
I'm a first class monkey if I can see how you can win pots by buying apples from old dames.
Can't find your apple, Dude?
Here's something for good luck.
Cut it out. Cut it out.
He wants apples, not lemons.
Happy, in case you break anything, make sure it's your neck.
- Hello, Annie.
- Hello, Dude.
- Did I keep you waiting?
- No.
You've got a great racket, Annie.
Couple more suckers like the Dude and you can retire in a year.
Pull up your chin, Happy, you're liable to step on it.
- Never mind the change.
- God bless you.
- So how'd you do last week?
- Okay.
Where were you Saturday?
I couldn't win a race.
Saturday?
I wasn't feeling so good Saturday.
- Drinking again.
- Who? Me?
I ain't touched a drop in weeks.
Cut it out.
Doc Michel says your kidneys are all shot.
He's an old fool, doesn't know what he's talking about.
If you two are going to discuss Annie's kidneys...
Your car's ready, Mr. Dude.
Mr. Dude, I can't find her no place.
There you are!
The Dude wants to see you.
Nice work, Shakespeare.
So long, Annie.
I bet the cards treat you right tonight, Dude.
They will, I'll tell 'em the Dude bought an apple from Annie.
Did you get it?
Don't I always get it?
- The classiest stationary we have.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Oscar.
- That bunch costs you 50 cents.
50 cents?
You never charge me more than two bits.
It's conditions.
People don't leave things in their rooms anymore.
It's got so bad I have to buy my own toothpaste.
- That's awful, Oscar.
- Even my wife's complaining.
Remember when she was the best-smelling woman on the block?
I brought her back so much perfume she used to stink with it.
- Cheer up. Things will get better.
- I guess so.
When are you expecting your next letter?
There's a mail boat in from Spain in the morning.
Okay, I'll watch out for it.
There's a good soul!
I'll pay you beginning of the week.
And don't you forget it.
If I'm caught stealing letters, I'll get fired.
- No, you mustn't get fired.
- They will if they catch me.
Who are you getting these letters from anyhow?
None of your business.
- A new lover, eh?
- That's it.
A new lover.
You old devil, you.
Get out of the way.
That's for getting in the way.
Hey, scat!
The very idea.
Couldn't you find any other place to sleep on but my picture?
"My dear... adorable... daughter. The social season... is over.
And so,
the reception... I came to... Lord... Lord Woodcliff's."
Here's to Lord Woodcliff.
"They say to wish you success."
I just love Annie's music.
"It breaks my heart that I've not been able to see you these years, but Doctor Michel, the old crab,
still says it would be fatal for me to make an ocean voyage.
Your stepfather thought he might make the trip this year."
You didn't know you had a stepfather, did you?"
Neither did I.
"The young man you write about sounds perfectly darling.
I hope he loves you as much as you love him.
As much as I love you, my darling.
Oscar, where have you been?
You shouldn't keep me waiting when I'm expecting a letter.
Why, Oscar.
Where's your uniform?
Oscar, what's happened?
You haven't lost your job?
You shouldn't fool me like this.
They can't fire you!
They can't, eh?
Well, they did.
They caught me putting your letter in my pocket.
Where's my letter?
What am I going to tell the wife?
That's what I want to know.
- Where's my letter?
- How do I know?
They took it.
Annie, where you going?
They won't let you in that way.
Hey!
Hey!
You must be in the wrong place, madam.
- Peasants aren't allowed in here.
- There's a strict rule about...
Let me go, let me go!
I beg your pardon.
Oh, my goodness.
There's some mail here for me, a letter.
Mail?
Are you stopping here, Madam?
No, but there's a letter.
It came this morning for me.
It's from Barcelona, Spain.
It's very important.
Well, what is your name, please?
Mrs. E. Worthington Manville.
- Mrs. E. Worthington Manville?
- Yes.
Mrs. E. Worthington Manville.
I'm the manager.
Anything I can do for you?
Yes, if you please.
There's a letter here for me and I'd like to get it.
Letter?
Addressed to the hotel?
Yes... I told that other man all about it.
When they're done, it looks as good as I do.
The idea is to make her look like a lady.
Laughing Boy is back.
All right, meat hammers, this is gonna be a sweet job.
- All right, Annie, let's go.
- We'll make you beautiful.
Come on.
Hair is the biggest problem.
It's okay, Annie.
You can't get to the first base.
You'll lead her on a string.
Take her to the bedroom.
Wait a minute, he can't go in there.
All right, dude, all right.
Pierre, please.
Okay, girls, that's all.
Guys, this is Mrs. E. Worthington Manville.
I'll never forget you for that.
God bless you.
Okay, all right.
Yeah, you look good.
You'd fool anyone.
Good work, Missouri.
Come on, Happy, let's go.
Wait a minute, guys.
Where are you going?
We're going back to the business of living.
- if you feel the same way.
- You think you're done?
- What about the man?
- Husband?
Worthington Manville, who's gonna dig it up?
I forgot the man.
Missouri, go back inside and tell her to take care of it herself.
That's a brilliant idea.
Who does she get, one of her panhandler friends?
He got her the apartment and a lot of clothes.
What else do you want?
- You can take care of it.
- Oh, I can, can I?
Very nice of you.
Whose idea was that anyway?
I'm a kibbutzer, now you want to give it to me?
You have another guess!
I like Annie as much as anyone else, but if you guys leave, I'll leave.
I'm a moron if I hold the bag.
You want the guy to give up his business?
I have to take care of a nightclub.
The weird hole in the wall?
Don't make me laugh.
If I could make you laugh, I'd get drunk!
You couldn't make a hyena laugh.
Wait, what do you mean, talking to her like that?
Stop fighting and let's do something.
If we have to dig up a husband, we'll get it over with.
Now you have to dig up a husband for her.
Where are you gonna get a man, just like that?
What about you, Happy?
Me?
That's a great idea.
I think you'd just be precious.
Wonderful idea.
There's only one thing in the way.
I have a woman who's very nervous.
She doesn't like me walking around and marrying people.
I know how unreasonable that must sound to you, but she's so weird.
Nope.
I only have one!
Judge Henry G. Blake.
Who's that?
For such a suggestion, we need a guy who talks stylishly.
Judge Blake is the most classicist speaker in the city.
Shakespeare.
- Yes, boss.
Judge Blake, the guy who told you you could shoot pool will take you to a sleigh ride.
Admittedly, my boy, admittedly.
In Providence, where I come from, a cripple like you would be taken for everything he has.
That's one of the reasons I never go into Providence.
If you did, you'd come back without your pants.
How long do I have to play with this be-knighted son of Providence?
Take it easy, Judge.
This guy's a piece of cake.
He's gonna want to go up the ante any minute.
I'm annoyed by those silly twaddles.
If the juice knew who the judge was, he'd go home.
If the stakes were higher, you could do better.
At last, success.
Better?
I doubt that, my friend.
I thought you might want to double the bet.
How about 10 cents a ball?
Ten cents?
A real fortune.
Scared, huh?
Fear?
Nobody ever said that to me and got away with it!
Did you know that during the reign of King Charles II we were called "The Fearless Blakes"?
I'll show you how scared I am!
I'll make 50 cents a ball!
Okay, come on!
- Boy, fuck her up!
Come on.
Put them up.
Let's go.
Judge.
My old friend, the Bard of Avon.
- This guy wants to see you right now.
- Can't be done, my friend.
I'm dealing with a very profitable company.
I don't know anything about that.
My room rental next month depends on it.
Come on, Judge, it's your chance.
Wait, the Dude said he shouldn't take no for an answer.
- You know what that means.
- Yeah, I had an occasion.
What's the matter, Judge?
Getting cold feet?
There he is, the lucky one.
I'm probably gonna lose him for life.
- Excuse me.
- Come in, Judge.
Guys, you guys hold on to the game.
I thought you were known as "The Fearless Blakes"?
You were born under a lucky star, my friend.
A 6 ball shot, friends, one in each pocket, shoot left-handed.
Amazing.
Quiet, boys!
Great shot!
- Collect from Providence.
That was a shot.
And with your left hand.
Thank you, my boy.
Go on, Shakespeare.
It's only for a week, Judge.
All you're doing is her rich, aristocratic husband.
The rich and aristocratic fit me admirably.
- Have you ever tried to be a husband?
- I'm notorious for that.
- How'd you make out?
- Offensive, pitiful.
They were also charming women, all four of them.
I'm sorry you mentioned that.
I don't understand why I should prove such a wretched failure.
You probably persuaded her to die.
- What do you mean?
- I'm interested.
- Whose husband?
- It's okay.
Here's the layout.
You're gonna be Apple Annie's always-loved husband.
That's absurd!
That's absurd!
Of all people, Apple Annie.
Look, dude, that's too much to ask.
A simple apple seller, practically a needy one.
- Hello.
- There she is now.
- Who is it?
- Apple Annie.
The judge said how glad he was to be your husband.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I feel deeply flattered.
The pleasure, I assure you, my dear and charming lady, is all mine.
Nineteen and a half.
See, Happy?
An apartment, clothes, judge Blake and that thing was fenced in.
Just between you and me, I've got a big bang.
Maybe we can revive the Babcock deal.
"Reviving"?
You mean you let it get away?
I let it get away?
You got into the job, huh?
I should have known.
Listen, Babcock took advantage of the seats of two pairs of pants sitting on his El Fideldo.
It's okay, it's okay.
Call him.
Tell him I'm ready.
I'll be right over.
I let it get away!
Hello, buddy.
- I'm glad I found you.
- What do you want?
I want to see you before the boat came in.
Annie's daughter arrives today.
Yeah, I know.
All right, men, scram.
I'll see you tomorrow.
I shouldn't hurry.
It's ruining my dignity.
What's on your mind, Judge?
Come on, I got something to do...
Dude, you played a heinous trick against this poor old woman.
Me what?
My dear Dude, do you know the number of reporters?
- that meet the arriving boats?
- And?
You'll want to know all about the Count, why he came to America, who his friends are.
That means me and Apple Annie.
Sure, a guy named Winchell would give his right eye for a story like this.
I told you you couldn't get away with it!
Why didn't you think about it?
Why didn't I think of that?
Exactly.
Why are you telling me now?
What do we do now?
What are you gonna do?
You started it.
It's your party.
Well, I'll leave it to you.
You better see the reporters stay away.
- When's the boat coming in?
- I hope it sinks.
In about an hour.
I'd better go with you to see that nothing goes wrong.
- Come on, Judge.
- Come on!
Goodbye, sad eyes.
This is 'phonus balonus'.
Yeah, Dave the Dude isn't here for his health.
His whole mafia isn't.
Tell your cups to keep a circle and not let anyone near us.
Don't worry, the only way they get in is with a tank.
- Let's see what happens.
- Not a bad idea.
- How do I look?
- Great.
- What does Annie look like?
- You don't know her, Schultzie.
I remember when Annie looked like this all the time.
Notterhead took me over and she smelled good.
I can't believe it.
In a while, I'll hold my baby in my arms.
Yeah, there she is.
There she is!
Louise!
Louise!
Louise!
Louise!
Look!
Louise, it's your mother.
There's Mother!
She recognizes me.
She recognizes me.
It's Mother!
It's Mother, my dear!
Mother!
- Louise.
- Louise.
I can't wait.
She'll be downstairs.
Louise!
Louise!
Louise!
My baby.
Let me look at you.
You're beautiful.
I'm so happy.
I'd know you anywhere.
- What are they doing?
- They're kissing.
- Is Annie happy?
- Yeah, she's crying.
Sweetheart!
You're just like I imagined you, Mother.
- My baby.
- Just like I imagined.
Enough tears here to drive a battleship.
That's your stepfather, dear.
Mother wrote so much about you.
May I introduce Count Alfonso Romero and his son Carlos?
Hello.
It's my pleasure, my dear Count.
We have been looking forward to this visit for some time.
Thank you.
How stupid of me.
This is your Uncle David.
My uncle?
I didn't know I had an uncle.
You must be Father's brother.
I'm so glad.
Mother, you haven't written a word about him.
That's because Brother David is the black sheep of the family.
I'd like you to meet Count Romero and his son Carlos.
- That's my uncle, David Manville.
- Hello.
- Where are you going?
- Are you talking to me?
I'm not talking to your Aunt Tilly.
I'm a news reporter.
I want to talk to the Count.
You're wrong.
He's not a count.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Yeah, somebody gave you a bum.
Show you what a rumor is about.
What you want to do is go to Pier 48.
A boat comes from the Argentines.
Maybe there's a king and a queen on it, you can't say that.
Take this man to Pier 48.
It's in the Bronx.
- But 48's on the battery.
- In the Bronx!
I wonder what her thug is?
Looks like a few foreigners are taken over.
Let's talk to the Dude.
Happy, some cops will see the Dude.
Holy smoke!
We have to stop them.
Start fighting.
Sock the Weasel.
- The weasel?
He's my brother!
- I said put it on.
Hey, weasel.
I hate to do that.
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
- Your car's waiting, sir.
- Thank you, my good man.
Some oos-bay!
We better get going.
The cars are waiting.
You'll enjoy the ride, Count.
- Do you know where the family went?
- You drove, sir.
- Where did they go yesterday?
- I think I'm on my way, sir.
- The day before?
- Same thing, sir.
That's all right.
Here... this is for your expenses.
- And this is for you.
- Thank you, sir.
- Do you remember your orders?
- Yes, sir.
"When questions are asked, I don't know anything.
In fact, I am completely stupid."
You think you can do this?
It should be a piece of cake.
Excuse me, sir?
I said this was supposed to be a lead tube cinch.
If I had a choice, I would choose grammar.
- Remember, don't scold it.
- No, sir.
If you do, you better send your family to the body.
- I don't have a family, sir.
- You won't have a body either.
No one...
Come on.
I don't want to be here when the family comes back.
Uncle David!
Hello.
There you are.
I'm so glad to see you.
Hello, Mr. Manville.
Where have you been?
We missed you terribly.
Well, that's something.
Don't be so weird.
Everyone's crazy about you.
Carlos and I will name our children after you.
If we talk about children, it would be a good idea to get married.
- When will it take place?
- I don't know.
Everybody's worried about it.
Mother wants the wedding here, only for the family.
The Count wants it in Spain, where the whole world is present.
I'm sorry, Ma...
We don't care where it happens as long as it happens.
That's how you talk.
- Hello, Brother David.
- Edward.
- Hello, Mr. McGuire.
- Judge.
You all know David's secretary.
Yes, my secretary, all together.
I'm so glad you came, Mr. McGuire.
Maybe you should invite him to our reception.
Sure, good idea.
Come on, Happy.
Reception?
What do you mean, "receive"?
We have a reception for the people the day after tomorrow, the night their boat returns to Spain.
Isn't that just Dandy?
You're surprised, aren't you, brother David?
Exactly.
I thought you knew me.
I've never known a man who hates receptions as much as the judge.
Who's coming, brother Edward?
Just a few of our friends.
A little affair, maybe 100, 150.
Hardly a handful.
The Count is tired of seeing buildings, isn't he?
He wants to meet our friends.
The Count will love our friends.
Of course I'll take care of you, brother David, to help me.
Of course.
I'd like to talk to you before you do anything about it.
There's one or two things I want to focus on.
Definitely, brother David.
- Yes, John?
- A newspaper servant, sir.
What does he want, John?
Maybe he heard about the Count and wants to write about him.
Maybe you'd better see him on the way out, brother David.
You're so clever in dealing with newspaper people.
I'll take care of him.
What can we do for you?
Society reporter, The Star.
I want a story about Mrs. E. Worthington Manville.
I can't mention them in the social register.
Can you imagine that?
He couldn't find them in the social register.
- I don't understand.
- What did you want to know?
Just a general biography.
Wait a minute.
Aren't you Dave the Dude?
Dave the Dude?
What's he talking about, Albert?
The house is full of guests.
Let's go somewhere undisturbed.
Okay, but I could swear you're Dave the Dude.
Here is a room that is not often used.
Are you sure we're not being disturbed, Arthur?
No, not a chance, Uncle.
This is for family heirlooms.
Again?
You're always gonna love me, aren't you, Carlos?
You know I will.
Did your father say anything yet?
Nope.
What will we do if he doesn't give his consent?
If he doesn't like mother and father?
- What do we do, Carlos?
- Don't worry, darling.
He really likes her.
He likes it when it comes to things.
I'd just die if something happened.
I'm just gonna die, Carlos.
Mother?
I was in my room and I was so lonely.
Don't you mind if I pay you a little visit?
- Of course not.
- It's my fault.
I took Louise's time.
I was terribly selfish.
No, you didn't.
You were cute.
I'll go in and talk to Dad if you'll excuse me.
Good night, Mother.
You don't mind calling you Mother, do you?
- I just love it.
- Thank you very much.
- Night, Louise.
- Good night, Carlos.
He's a nice boy.
Mother, I'm so happy.
My baby.
Mother?
Yeah, honey.
Do you think nothing can happen?
What's happening?
I guess I was stupid because I wanted so much.
Mother, have you ever wished for something so hard that...?
Nothing's gonna happen.
Nothing's gonna happen.
Reception, huh?
You were up too late.
You're in a great apartment, and you started believing it.
For my money, you're still a penny ante pool shark!
- Well, my dear Dude...
- Shut up.
- No cross, brother David.
- Not "Brother David" me!
Listen...
Hello.
What do you want?
I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Dude, but the Count asked me to call the Spanish Consulate on the phone.
Why is he calling him?
What do you know about it?
He's calling the Spanish Consulate.
Maybe he's checking us out.
- How's your Spanish, Happy?
- Good as my Frenchman, they smell.
What about you?
I'll tell you when I was in Havana.
It doesn't matter!
Hello.
- The Spanish Consulate, sir.
- Thank you very much.
Close the door, please.
Consular not at home.
Just me, Japanese boy.
No, sir.
Consular not at home.
He's gone a long time.
Maybe you'll come back next week.
No, my Japanese boy.
Consular not at home.
Thank you.
Very good.
Very, very good.
Japanese boy.
Very hard to understand.
I think he said Consular outside the city.
I'm glad.
I think it was very unportable.
Carlos!
I'm sorry, Father, but that's how I feel.
- It would be terrible if...
- It can't be helped, son.
After all, we don't know anything about these people.
I may be wrong, but her behavior seems... strange.
I can't quite put my finger on it.
What difference does it make?
- I love Louise.
- Let me handle this.
If they're okay, you can get married as soon as we return home.
There's no reason we can't wait until the reception is over before we decide.
I want to meet her friends.
And what about it?
What about the reception?
The reception, my dear Dude, if a small word is allowed, is inevitable.
I don't know what's stopping me from putting a snail in you.
Personally, I wouldn't mind.
I'm bored with all this bad life.
He was a wise old sage who said, "Every man over 40 should be wiped out."
- Who said that?
- I don't know, someone should have.
What good is a man over 40?
Take yourself, for example.
- Yeah, I'm only 34.
- Just 34.
- I would have sworn you were 50.
- What is it?
Look at you.
Well irritated.
No, you're kidding me!
By the way, I have a very good practice for that.
It's something like this, a head movement.
You do it 24 times every morning.
- Like that, huh?
- No, more movement up and down.
- Like that, huh?
- Yeah, that's much better.
I'm sorry I pissed off your Kalisthenic.
But you tried to infect him a few minutes ago.
Yeah, that's right.
How about this?
What should I do, say my prayers?
- No, about the reception.
- It should be that simple.
Rodney Kent's apartment, some clothes, and it's a wipe.
What a shock you'll get when you wake up on the bare steel.
- What for?
- It's a simple question of kidnapping.
It's 'the law', I was told.
You mean the society reporter?
No, I mean these three company reporters.
Three of them?
Sure.
We had to put them in the bag.
Take a look at the headlines.
Let's see if your Japanese dialect gets you out of here.
Forget it.
You're still in Rodney Kent's storage room?
Exactly.
- Bugs Malone with them?
- That's right.
Forget it.
I'll tell you later.
What interests me most is the reception.
You go to Annie's and tell her it's all over.
- What is it?
I guess I'm a sentimental old fool, but don't ask me to deliberately break the heart of this poor old woman.
Stop, you're breaking mine.
Where are you gonna get these people?
You must have a lot of high-class people, right?
That, my dear Dude, is very simple.
It may surprise you to know that I have found the solution in my senile way.
Look, in reality, I'm Judge Henry G. Blake, exponent of pool, penny ante pool, if you want.
Yeah, come on.
But for Count Romero, I'm E. Worthington Manville,
- a celebrated statesman.
- That's right.
Is there any reason why Louie the Lug couldn't be an ambassador to Turkey?
What?
Or would the weasel not be an excellent...
- War minister?
The weasel?
When Missouri Martin was introduced to me as the leader of New York society,
- I wouldn't doubt that.
- I would.
And the girls in her club?
There you have two dozen of the city's best debutants.
You're crazy!
Open their kissers and the roof would fall on them.
That's the trick.
They won't open their kisses except for a few introductory speeches I'm going to accuse them of.
Judge, I think you have it.
Sure, why not?
I'll tell them that the first person to open his Yap will be subdued.
Where's my address book?
I give up.
When Louie becomes the Lug ambassador to Turkey, I don't want to be there anymore.
I'm going to the lunatic home with some reasonable people.
Judge, help me.
You answer the phone and see if anyone's at Boyle's.
That's a great idea, Judge.
We're gonna marry Apple Annie's daughter or rip a belly!
Hello, my good man.
Would you connect me to Harry's horse?
Hello, Butch.
- Yes?
- Captain Moore, Inspector.
- Send him in!
- Yes, sir.
And?
Nothing to do, Inspector.
That's what you told me yesterday and the day before.
We need to find the three reporters and fast!
Look what the newspapers are doing to us!
I've done everything and covered every angle.
Nothing but excuses, that's all I got.
You better go...
- Yes?
- The commissioner on the phone.
- Who?
- The commissioner.
There he is again.
Fourth time today.
Hello, Commissioner.
No, I have Cap. Moore in my office.
Nothing?
That's all I've been getting for a few days.
What have you got there, a bunch of schoolboys?
Listen, McCreary, I'm not going to be the goat of the department.
Find the reporters, or I...
Hello.
- The mayor's on the phone, sir.
- The mayor?
- Yes, sir.
- Didn't you tell him I was out?
- No, I didn't.
- All right, put it on.
Yes, sir.
Wait a minute.
The mayor's on the phone again.
Hello.
Yeah, hello, boss.
No, I just spoke to Inspector McCreary.
Nothing yet.
What are you gonna do about it?
Sit down and wait for the reporters to come to your office?
Yeah, I've heard that before.
I'm only interested in one thing.
I want some action and quick!
Every editor in town is in my office right now.
You get editorials on the front page every day until something happens.
Our reporters can't get messages without bodyguards.
I would like to make this clear, Commissioner: I refuse to put the main burden on police incompetence!
If the city administration can't do anything, maybe it's the state.
If the governor is in town this afternoon, we'll see him.
Find the reporters, or I'll have to ask you to resign.
That's final.
Hello, McCreary.
Now dig up the reporters or I'll get another boy.
And that's it!
Captain, I'll give you 24 hours to find the reporters.
If you can't, you better look for another job.
And this is the work!
Yes, sir.
What's going on, Murphy?
A young guy with a look at the reporter business.
- Come on, talk louder.
I was down by the boats talking to a count when a few yeggs grabbed me and put me in a car.
- What happened?
- You took me to the Bronx?
- How did you get away?
- They stopped and I jumped out.
- Who were the men?
- I don't know.
Maybe I can tell you something about it, Inspector.
When did this happen?
- Last Tuesday.
- That looks good.
Ken and I worked at the pier last week.
Dave the Dude met some people.
He had all his mob with him.
We thought it was funny.
Dave the Dude, huh?
It looks like a police department.
Sit down, I want to talk to you.
I'm not gonna do this sample because I like it!
The reception is tomorrow night.
If you don't want to rehearse now, you're gonna screw this thing up.
You've prepared your titles, speeches, everything.
Learn your speeches first.
The judge has tried to fix some great ones, and I don't want you to blow them up.
All right, come on.
Let's go.
No, no.
You're too stiff, you're too stiff.
Take it easy, don't you?
Butch, bend your legs.
Bend off your waist.
Harry the horse... you don't want to look like you're kicking her!
No, and smile.
Come on, keep smiling.
Sure, you should have a good time.
What do you think you're doing?
You're the ambassador to Turkey, not a wrestler.
Holy mackerel, that's terrible.
Cheesecake.
What's going on?
Is it too much for you?
- No, I can do this.
- Just what?
I'm as good as Louie the Lug every day.
If he's ambassador, I should be king.
Look, the Minister of the Interior is bigger than ambassadors.
- Yes?
- Sure.
You can't fool me.
A secretary is a secretary.
Then you are President of the Board of Directors.
How do you like it?
President?
It's like that!
Judge, we have a new Chief Executive Officer.
Check!
Come here.
You too, Micks.
You two do your things.
Quiet!
The rest of you, quiet!
Micks, here's the count.
Now I want to hear your speech.
- Did I knock on that guy?
- He knows you.
I understand you, I understand you.
Count... I'm... it's a rare... it's a rare... privy...
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
It's a rare Privilege, you moron.
I can't make the note with words like that.
Listen...
- If the judge...
You're driving me crazy!
What's going on?
Will you all stop?
Come on, let's go.
Samples!
Nice to meet you.
You stink.
Call it.
- Head.
- Tails!
That makes me king of Siam.
A few more wins and you'll take over the whole world.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Quiet, guest.
Quiet.
Shut up!
Looks like we have to take it at once.
Forget the speeches now, pick up the bow.
Judge, come and show them how to bow.
Now, watch it.
Look, his knees don't buckle up.
Look where the hand is, isn't that graceful?
Look at that smile.
See, there's nothing hard on it.
Come on, everybody's doing this.
No talking.
Just bow.
Everyone bows now.
I don't believe it.
Where are you going?
Come here.
It's about time you showed up.
I beg you...
You made me do it now.
Don't worry, you could take a lot of practice.
Stop clowning.
These guys made me crazy.
You're not doing them any good.
I'm going through this, see?
Hey, stop it.
Stop it.
Wait a minute, everybody.
Trouble with many of you is that you don't take it seriously.
Well, let me tell you something.
It's serious... and the guy who doesn't think he can record it now on the lam.
Listen, guys, I don't want to get tough on you guys, but we have to do it.
It's not for me.
No one's gonna get anything.
Happy I'm crazy.
Well, maybe I am, I don't know.
But I started and I have to go through with it.
It's for Apple Annie, see?
She's in a difficult situation and it's up to us to take a break.
If something goes wrong tomorrow night, there's no idea what she's gonna do.
So let's practice hard and practice.
Now we're taking up Apple Annie's speech.
All you girls are is Apple Annie, you see?
Guys, get a lady.
They'll be introduced to her.
All right, guys.
Let's get organized.
The Apple Annie speech.
Give him some ginger.
- Quiet, guys.
- Quiet, guys.
- Quiet!
- Quiet!
The Indians are after us.
- Hello, buddy.
- Hello.
- What's going on?
- Nothing you'd care about.
It's funny you're up here.
Is there something wrong with a guy who has his friends?
No, there's nothing wrong with that.
These cups are noble, aren't they?
Okay, guys, go home.
The rehearsal's over.
You're doing a show, dude?
- That's right.
- Yeah, it's a benefit.
Good night, dude.
See you.
Dude and Fish are what understands me.
The whole mob was up there.
You didn't ask about the three reporters, did you?
That's good.
- Yes, sir?
- Send in O'Brien and Gibbons.
You two watch the Dude and don't let him know he's under surveillance.
Everything looks wrong, let me know right away.
I want a dick on each of the Dude's Mobs.
The names are in the file.
Use every man in the department if you need to.
I want these Yeggs to be tailed 24 hours a day, from now on.
Let's go!
- Mommy.
- I'm sorry, honey.
Here, go to sleep, good night.
Good night, Mommy.
The music must be soft and gentle.
Nothing terrible, nothing terrible.
Our guests have very tender nerves.
Play at intervals of 10 minutes.
Do we understand each other?
Let it happen.
- Is that the two men?
- Yes, sir.
- Do they know their requirements?
- I explained everything, sir.
Excellent, John.
Then put something on to me.
Put some down there.
You're sure it looks okay?
- I don't want it to go wrong.
- Yes, ma'am.
Come in.
Do my eyes deceive me, or am I in the presence of an angel?
Stop it, Judge.
Never in all my questionable career have I looked at such divine loveliness.
Stop it, Judge.
Exquisite!
- When are they coming?
- Eight o'clock, my dear.
- Do you think they can do this?
- Are you doing this?
You're gonna do it, or you're gonna do it!
The guy rehearsed them until they're ready to fall.
- I'm so nervous.
- There, there, my little dewdrop.
Don't worry.
If something happens, I'll be there to cover up.
- Leave it to the old judge.
- Oh, you're so good.
Dude and his whole mafia are up in Missouri Martins and there's a sign on the joint: 'CIOSED'.
I didn't find out what it was about, but it looks deceptive.
There are a number of cars outside of a block long.
Don't let her get away from you.
And more, don't let Dude find out he's being watched.
He's a pretty smart article.
Okay, keep in touch with me.
- Hello.
- Moore there?
- Yes, sir.
- Put it on.
Moore's talking.
Moore, better get the riot squad ready, 25 men.
Machine guns, tear bombs, everything.
- We might have a job.
- All right, sir.
Sometimes I'm a little ashamed of my fellow Americans, they worship and worship celebrities.
- That's charming.
- They're like kids.
You'll notice tonight.
In your presence, they will probably stammer and be in tongue binding.
I beg you to give them money.
Of course.
Different countries, different characteristics.
Which reminds me that there is custom in my country, which is obviously not American.
I've been waiting for you to mention it.
- What's that, Count?
- The dowry, my dear judge.
Nothing was said about the dowry.
- The dowry?
- The dowry.
The dowry.
I'm aware that it's not considered very important in America, but in my country...
An old Spanish custom, huh?
A very old custom.
I don't know what to say, Count.
What did you say?
I said I wasn't fully prepared for it.
It's a delicate subject, you know?
Maybe you don't know who your son's getting married to?
Manville, sir!
A descendant of the General of the Revolutionary War,
George Washington Manville.
Have you heard of him?
I'm sorry, but I didn't.
Well, that's weird.
And on her mother's side, she comes from the purest supply.
Do you know that, if not for them, there would be no apple industry in America?
Undoubtedly.
But my son also comes from an old and respected family, but I make an agreement of $50,000.
Really?
Maybe you'd make a similar one?
I don't know anything about that.
If you don't want to talk about it...
Look at this.
Billiards.
Why didn't you tell me you had a pool room?
Are you playing?
Do I play?
I'm a champion in Valencia!
Isn't that just... that's not what you say?
Maybe before the guests arrive, we could...
Nothing would give me any more pleasure.
Now...
- Because of the dowry, Count...
- Yes, please?
...I remember when the children live with you in Spain... I'll give the whole amount.
No, no.
I wouldn't let that happen.
After all, it's only $100,000.
Yeah, that's true, but why would you carry the whole load?
No, I don't assure you anything.
I can afford it.
In this respect, I can do the same.
You're so gracious, I'm ashamed.
Nothing would give me more pleasure than taking care of it.
- No, that would be unfair.
- But Señor, I want to do it.
No, no, no.
I'm on the daughter's side.
- I have the right.
- Well, senor, I insist.
That's silly.
We could go on like this for hours.
In America, we have ways to deal with this.
We throw coins, or we pull straws...
What amuses you, Count?
I just thought I could take advantage of you.
- Yes, please?
How?
- By proposing billiards.
- I don't understand why not.
- No, no.
That would be very unfair.
Maybe not.
You never notice.
- Are you playing well?
- Do I play well?
I'm practically making a living.
I warned you.
Everybody on your toes.
And no drinking, understand?
It won't take more than four hours.
They catch a boat at midnight.
Do you remember who they're supposed to be?
Exactly.
What do you have in mind for me, Dave?
A leading member of the Society in New York, Missouri.
Are you going to insult me?
I'm family, see?
If there's an uncle, there's an aunt.
Guys, meet the wife of Uncle Dave, the Dude Manville.
Look, dude, she's sneaking you back in.
Okay, anything you want.
Well, that's done.
And remember, you palookas, you're gentlemen, see?
Come on, Happy.
Dave, I want to tell you what a great thing you're doing.
And I love you for it!
Woman, what?
Get away from me.
Hello, Smiley.
Watch it, dude.
The cops.
I've been following you all day.
What's going on?
- What's going on, Dave?
- The cops, millions of them.
The cops?
I thought you said it was upstairs and upstairs.
- If there's anything crazy.
- Shut up!
Come on, Nick, calm down.
We can't go to the Marberry now.
They'll follow us.
- What do we do now?
It's cold, we're breaking up.
Don't call.
Let me think about it.
What luck!
Amazing, isn't it?
I was very lucky.
Do you realize you'll win if you look at this?
Really?
Then I have to make it.
I'm afraid this shot is practically impossible, Count.
- It can be done.
- Yeah, you mean?
You shave the white one very well, go around the table, hit the red one down here.
That's too much for me, Count.
Take an expert to do this.
Excuse me, sir.
Your brother's on the phone for you.
- Brother David?
- Yes, sir.
He says it's important.
I'll be right there.
You did it!
Oh, the happiest.
Hello.
Yeah, that's him.
Congratulations, David.
I just saved you $50,000.
It doesn't matter.
Look, we're in a mess.
We're at Missouri Martin's. The place is surrounded by cops.
The cops?
I don't like that at all, my dear Dude.
You suggest I fold my tent and run into the night?
Don't leave the house.
Stay there and stay there until I find out something.
As you say, dude.
But I don't like it when I hold the familiar bag.
What's the matter, Judge?
What happened?
Nothing at all, my dear.
I heard you said something about the cops.
- You're not coming here, are you?
- No, of course not.
Don't make a fool of me, Judge.
Tell me the truth.
Don't get upset.
You have to keep your head.
Yeah, but I'm the one...
I should know.
Don't make a fool of me.
I'd rather go in there and tell them the truth!
Stinking cops are still out there.
Thank you.
When are the guests supposed to come here?
I don't know, sir.
- Could you tell me...?
- No, sir.
What do we do now?
What if the police come here?
What do you want me to tell the Count?
What do you want me to say to Louise?
Shut up, Annie.
The police don't come here.
Poor Louise.
Poor sweet and lovely girl.
- Don't you think, Judge?
- Of course.
Suppose...
Suppose the Count should cancel the wedding?
It would kill Louise.
And she would hate me.
Don't be silly, Annie.
She'll want to know... about her father.
What can I tell her?
What can I tell her?
I've never been married, Judge.
Now, my dear.
You don't have to tell her.
All these years, I've kept it from her, and she's never allowed to find out.
Oh, no, please...
- Annie, shut up.
- No, please.
- Don't let them find out.
- Annie, control yourself.
You think I'd come here if it wasn't on the level?
You have to take my word.
You have to let me go tonight!
What else do you want, the key to the city?
What's all your gang doing at Missouri Martin?
- You've got a gossip.
- Nothing you'd care about.
But I can't tell you about it.
If I could, you'd see how stupid it is to make all this uproar.
Leave me alone tonight, I'll do anything.
I'll help you find the reporters.
- That's what you want, isn't it?
- Sure.
Where'd you get it, Dude?
I don't have them, but I'm sending the message that the reporters will be back at their desks tomorrow.
Call your men by noon tonight.
Sorry, dude, there's nothing I can do.
You'll have a police escort until the reporters show up.
If you feel that way, I'll tell you something.
You're right!
I have these reporters.
But they won't show up, you know?
They won't show up until I'm good and ready to produce them.
- Are you going to do business now?
- Sure, we're doing business.
- Mac.
So you have the reporters?
I thought so.
Arrest these two guys.
It won't do you any good.
You can always do business with the police.
- Yes, sir?
- Give me the mayor.
I don't think you can get him.
He's having a party for the governor.
I'll get him if he finds out it's about the reporters.
I wouldn't be surprised if the mayor would make a deal with you.
Don't be a fool, Commissioner.
Why are you dragging the mayor in there?
You want the reporters, don't you?
The papers are making a fool of you.
Now you can come out upstairs.
What?
Tell him it's about the reporters.
There's nothing crooked about the whole thing.
You'd laugh at your head if you'd heard the story.
Sure, I'm laughing.
- Hello, Chief.
- Wait a minute.
Before you talk to him, I'll tell you the whole story.
You'll think I'm crazy, but here's the real low point.
You believe in fairy tales, don't you?
What?
No, it's no use.
I'll hang before you let me laugh at the horse.
Talk to the mayor, talk to everyone you want, but I'll tell you one thing, you'll never see the reporters.
Hello, Chief.
I got Dave the Dude here.
Yeah, he admits to having the three reporters.
He does, doesn't he?
Call the governor.
Governor.
Dave the Dude admits to having the reporters.
Very good!
Have they arrested him yet?
I'm sure they arrested him, Governor.
But what's going to happen now?
A bail bond will get him out in the morning.
- That's ridiculous.
- That's how it works in this town.
He's got a huge nerve.
He can't do business with the police.
There's an example for you.
He wants to make a deal with us.
If we don't leave him alone tonight, we'll never see her.
- That's outrageous!
- Don't be happy, Governor.
That's the usual procedure.
Bring Dave in the Dude.
Yeah, that's exactly what I said.
Bring him here.
Don't worry about my guests.
That's more important.
You have freely criticized this government, let's see what you can do.
I'll have you spread it on the front page!
I'd send a criminal like that away for life!
Here's your chance, Governor.
It was all so easy.
Ask them if they believe in fairy tales.
Look at her skulls.
It's a rare privilege.
- It's a rare...
Stop it, Cheesecake.
I don't mind telling you that you smell in heaven.
Why don't you learn like I told you?
- You get worse every time.
- Shakespeare, I'm exhausted.
How can a guy unlax when he's exhausted?
Look, Simon Legree, we've been doing this for hours.
The guy said to keep practicing, didn't he?
So we're gonna practice.
Everybody.
On your feet.
Throw yourself in!
Do as I told you.
Close the door, Stuttgart.
Come on, Lefty, get in the car.
Now the Apple Annie speech.
Keep practicing.
Don't stop.
Hello, buddy.
But dude, we're all ready, everybody's been practicing.
Everyone looks great.
Okay, buddy.
- I'll tell them.
- What's going on?
- The guy says it's all over.
- It can't be!
The guy said it was all over.
Send all the suits back.
What a break for Annie.
You're trying to do something decent, and they won't let you.
Poor Annie.
Mother...
Mother... is something wrong?
I heard the Counts say that there will be no reception.
No one coming?
My baby.
- Louise, darling?
- Yes, Mother.
If something happened, would you never hate your mother?
Don't say that.
Please don't say that.
Is the Count in the salon?
Yes.
Annie, where are you going?
Where are you going?
Count Romero, I would like to speak to you for a few moments.
In the world, I don't want more than Louise marrying your son.
Louise loves him, loves him very much.
And I'm sure he loves her, too.
Ever since she was born, I've only had one thought in my head, her happiness.
When she wrote and told me that she found someone she loved,
I think I was the happiest mother in the world.
Count Romero, you came here to learn about her... her family, about me.
I can't blame you.
You had a perfect right.
You didn't know anything about us.
It would be terrible if you found out after her wedding that her mother was someone you'd be ashamed of.
Someone she'd be ashamed of.
That's silly, Mother.
That's why I wanted to talk to you, Count Romero.
I wanted to tell you all about us.
I want to tell you...
His honor, the mayor!
Go ahead, mayor.
Do your things.
It's your idea.
My dear Mrs. Manville, it's good to see you again!
Last time was at your very nice party in Briarwood. I'll never forget it. Brilliant.
And that, I suppose, is your very charming daughter.
Count Romero and his son Carlos.
Hello.
Welcome to our town.
I'll recognize you right away, Mayor.
I saw you in the weekly shows.
- Thank you very much.
- Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
- It's a miracle.
- Two miracles.
The governor.
His Excellency, the Governor!
What's the old Apple Annie's name?
Mrs E. Worthington Manville.
- Oh, my God, don't forget it!
Mrs. Manville, I can't tell you what a pleasure, what a privilege it is for us to be here tonight at your wonderful reception.
Your charming daughter, I suppose?
The governor's taking us to the boat.
Not bad, huh?
As a child, they had a hard time making me believe in Santa Claus.
Father, a police escort!
That's more than they do for us in Valencia.
You're very influential, my friend.
This?
Nothing, I assure you.
An admirable woman.
A delightful experience.
I felt ten years younger.
I assume, Governor, now that you're in town, you'll be following the investigation at City Hall.
No, I think we've been a little hard on them.
I guess I was a little impatient with the administration, Mayor.
I'm sorry about my attitude tonight.
- It's okay.
I have to remember to call the Commissioner tomorrow.
I made his life miserable.
You guys have to excuse me if I'm gonna get a little tough on you guys in a while.
I know you're doing your best.
Okay, Commissioner, okay.
That's how you're gonna write the story.
Is that clear?
What about the kidnapping?
Who said you were abducted?
You were drunk, you understand?
Drunk?
- You're handing over this story?
- You were on a drunk!
Hold on!
Goodbye.
Goodbye, Mother.
This is J.L.
This is J.L.
- I've been waiting half an hour.
- Not now, I'm busy.
I have to get all his sons on the phone.
Maine 674.
The board meeting tonight.
That's the first one.
You know there's a meeting tonight.
The whole city knows.
That's right, J.L. Insists reports officially.
Hi, Higgins hardware?
Mr. Early, please.
Higgins.
Higgins!
It's not a family, it's a disease.
Henry early said.
Yes, Mrs. Petersen.
I would just like to remind you that a board meeting will take place at 7 p.m.
Arthur Winslow is speaking.
Yes, Mrs. Petersen.
Of course.
The usual time, yes.
Mr. Brooks hasn't been here all day.
I don't know.
You have to tell him that his father-in-law is expecting him.
Yes, Mrs. Peterson.
Did you try his home?
His wife could...
She hung up.
We need to find Mr. Brooks.
That's ridiculous.
He must be in his office.
He's not... and you know how hard your father is at meetings.
I'll make sure he's there.
I think I know where he is.
All right, Whitey.
Here comes the home stretch.
Come on!
Come on, Broadway Bill!
Princess, hurry up.
Take him to the barn.
I'll see you there.
Hot Digidy!
- What did he do with it?
- One minute, 40 seconds.
- 1:40?
- That's right.
Man, that's gonna knock off for a second.
He could break the world record.
Hello, Bill.
Good boy.
- He can pick her up.
- He's still stopping.
- Stalling?
- That's right.
- As fast as you can see.
- Good work.
- He's great.
- What's that?
She taught Skeeter that.
- Skeeter?
- Miss called him that.
You got a mascot, buddy.
- The greatest friends.
- You know more about him than I do.
You're hanging out a lot, Princes.
- Make something of it?
- For Emperor Higgins.
Don't let him catch it.
Emperor Higgins doesn't know I'm alive.
I'm just the young brat.
Get married, give him another son-in-law.
Someone to take care of another Higgins company.
No, thank you.
- I'm coming.
Throw him around for about an hour.
- Any carrots?
- Six, but not more.
Not seven?
Take care of him, or I'll break your neck.
Come on, Bill.
A great horse!
I wish he ran right away.
He's got background, stamina.
Ana a will to win.
This is important for a horse.
The Imperial Racetrack was opened last week.
Do you think I don't know?
I saw you, Bill Taylor.
- Why don't you?
- What's not?
Get Broadway Bill on track.
Are you crazy?
What are you waiting for?
You wanted to get out of Higginsville.
Your heart's in horses and you're making paper boxes.
That doesn't make any sense.
- What's gotten into you?
- Nope.
You're a fool, Daddy.
- That's me, isn't it?
- Yes.
You've become another Higgins slave.
- Remember, if I have an idea?
- What's going on?
I've always been honest.
I'd cut my right arm off before I lie to you.
What's going on?
I read my Bible and I don't screw it up.
What are you gonna tell me?
I've added things.
And subtract, share, and multiply, and get the same answer.
It wouldn't be honest to win Bill for someone else.
Who asked you?
Come on, get out of here.
- Yes, sir.
- See you.
Come on, Bill.
Mr. Brooks!
Your wife wants you to come home right away.
- There's a meeting tonight.
- Hit it.
- But she...
- Get out of here, I told you!
I just wanted to tell you.
It's very important.
- Margaret...
- Yes?
He made 1:40.
How's that?
- Who made 1:40?
-Broadway Bill.
He must have at least 150 weights.
There's a meeting tonight.
Get ready to wear.
Let's start the meeting.
You're bathing?
Sure.
Smells horribly for me.
I'll take four when we set up the meeting.
- Don't be silly.
- There's a full moon.
Let's sit under it all night.
Or two nights, a week.
What do you mean?
What's eating you?
Same old bug.
Father would have a royal seizure if we didn't show up.
We have to go.
Hang up the meeting.
What difference does it make?
Your father will have the whole conversation and we'll go:
Yes, J.L. Of course, J.L.
I have chronic pain in my neck when I nod.
Don't be a fool.
Let's throw the stone as the meeting.
You say such stupid things.
Let's do something else.
Why don't you get a zipper?
One day, you call the meetings and don't want stones.
That would be absolute idiots.
Now hurry up, we're gonna be late.
- What about the moon?
- Come on.
- Margaret...
- Good heavens.
- I know I'm a pest.
- We'll never get there!
I'm serious.
What if I tell you I'm sick of dying a slow death?
Would you go with me?
- Where?
- Everywhere I can do my own life, do whatever I want.
The racing business, I suppose.
I'm not interested in making paper boxes.
You want me to give it all up?
Why not?
Live without knowing where my next meal comes from.
- Wait for miracles.
- It's better than this.
Don't you mind your husband being a parasite?
That's me.
There's no point in fucking with me.
I got a job because I married you.
Father thinks you're awfully clever.
That's why the others are jealous.
He's got big plans for you, and one day...
Yeah, I know.
A crown prince.
- Good evening, Johnson.
- Good evening, Mr. Mrs. Early.
J.L.'s in the study.
- Good evening, J.L.
Father.
Good evening, Father.
Don't scold me, I'm on time.
J.L.'s in the study.
You're not the smartest, but you're the best.
Thank you.
Heinrich, Matilda.
Good evening, Father.
- Good evening.
- Mrs. Brooks, Mr. Brooks.
- Hello, Johnson.
J.L.'s in the study.
- Good evening.
- Hello.
Hello, Dad.
Hello, princess.
- You're late.
- I know.
It's all my fault.
Let's get started.
Do you want to know that's what it was?
You and Broadway talked too long.
Do you think I'm gonna get thrown into the Bastille?
You'll be lucky if you don't get beheaded.
Before I go to the hack block, could you dig up a pinch of whiskey?
Whiskey, in this house?
Has nothing changed about this mausoleum?
Yes, duvets and underwear.
That's something.
As far as the Acme Lumber Company is concerned, we bought it today.
And this morning it's the Higgins Lumber Company.
I trust that this will be approved by you.
Sure.
Of course.
I hope it meets yours.
Of course, J.L.
He doesn't have an active head for the present, and he'll stay that way until he gets a free chair here... appropriately populated.
If you mean me, you're wasting your time.
What's that?
The man I'm marrying doesn't care about the wood business.
- Don't be rude.
- I'm sorry.
There's no further discussion of the business until after dinner.
I'm happy to say that all Higgins companies are good.
All except the Higgins Paper Box Company.
I'm sorry the sale fell into a dangerous phase.
I've got the numbers ahead of me.
The first 3 months of the financial year... style 4, all colors, fell 14%.
The Higgins Special we've been producing for 20 years that we've been nationally identified with... 22%.
The company needs more application of its management.
You can't expect a business to thrive when the head galvanizes with a horse.
What's your point?
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Yes.
It's obvious.
You came here three years ago, destitute and... with a questionable background.
It's kind of a connection to the racetrack business.
I was broad enough to overlook that.
You and Margaret wanted to get married, and I agreed.
I've put you at the top of the Higgins Box Company, the largest and most successful of the Higgins companies.
You took on this responsibility with enthusiasm, and I could even say gratitude.
You were the envy of Mr. Early and Mr. Winslow.
Their first two years were successful.
But last year the company suffered immensely.
I'm adding it to a cause:
Neglect.
Shameful neglect.
As of tomorrow morning, you will devote yourself exclusively to your business.
And get rid of the horse.
Make sure it's done.
I looked through the books of the Acme Lumber Company.
Cash on hand and in the banks, $13.672 and 86 cents. Account receivables, $32.842...
Wait, Mr. Higgins.
I'm not selling my horse.
I'm leaving Higginsville in the morning.
Quiet!
What you're saying is true.
I neglected business.
The reason is simple:
I've always hated it.
It's a good deal.
It's okay... for you, or Mr. Winslow, or Mr. Early.
They're suitable, and I'm not.
I may sound crazy, and maybe I am, but you seem to do the same to me.
Everything seems to be wrong.
Higginsville, the Higgins family, the Higgins companies.
We don't speak the same language.
You're just interested in raising money, expanding the little ones, banging.
You just took Acme away from some poor people.
- Hope it makes you happy.
- Careful with what you say!
You haven't been on vacation for 40 years and you've rotted in your kingdom.
If that's your idea of a high life, it's neither mine nor Margaret's.
I wouldn't get rid of that horse for you or anyone else.
One day you'll take your hat off to Broadway Bill.
I was broke when I came here, but we don't want anything from Higginsville.
Accept my resignation.
I'll wait for you in the car, Margaret.
You don't have to complain.
The meeting is adjourned.
Why shouldn't I applaud him?
He should've been gone by now.
What's all this talk?
Your little monarchy folds quickly.
Your crown prince is ready.
Stop this nonsense!
You are a strong and powerful ruler, oh mighty king.
But you won't crush him anymore.
What's the matter with you?
You seem very happy.
I'm so glad I could scream.
I could go out on roofs and scream.
I prayed for him every night.
I hope he's never back in Higginsville.
Oh, Father.
Listen.
I feel ten years younger.
How are you feeling?
I'm on my way to the last round.
The time has come.
I'll leave sad times aside.
I'm on my way to the last round.
Hey, what's up?
- What's up?
- She's here, Gallant Lady.
A gallant lady?
I have to look at it.
Hello, Dan.
Where have you been all these years?
Hides under rocks.
Bradshaw, come here.
- Where are you going?
- Hello, Mike.
Go back.
I can't get Gallant Lady out like that. She's too nervous.
Get off the platform.
Go back, will you?
Officer, do your duty.
Don't tell me what to do.
All right, Mr. Whitehall.
All right, get her out of here.
Get her out of here.
Keep your head down and watch her feet.
- That's a beautiful animal.
- She's gonna win the Derby.
Make way.
Hello, Mr. Morgan.
Dan Brooks, remember me?
- How are you?
- All right, thank you.
- Who are you betting on?
-Gallant Lady, of course.
Don't put your money down yet, maybe I have some use for it.
- We bet on Sun Up.
- Why not?
Don't be a fool, you don't have a chance with the horse.
Try a few small races first.
I'll be back in style.
Nobody knows anything about Broadway Bill, and if he wins...
You don't think he can beat Gallant Lady, do you?
Why not?
- In his first race?
- I know what he can do.
How much does the entry cost?
I give up.
You must have rapped your senses in paper boxes.
$500.
It's a $25,000 race.
That's cheap enough.
- Did you make the bill?
- Now?
You can do it the day before the race, it's in 2 weeks.
Yeah, I'll have money transferred.
You have to nominate him before 6:00.
How much?
$50.
50?
I'll be right back.
How much money do you have?
- Money?
- Yeah, get it out.
You're in the wrong place.
I have this sad and lonely dollar.
I'm about five.
Bring it up.
- Five bucks?
I'm the poorest person you've ever seen.
See that?
If there's money there, I'd be surprised.
- Bless my soul!
- That's what I'm saying.
Hey, boots, you're not my pocket book anymore.
- Your receipt.
- Thank you very much.
How about a stable?
I had another one and I just gave it to Gallant Lady.
Whitehall insisted on having it for himself.
He'd take Gallant Lady out of the race if...
Without Gallant Lady, you wouldn't have any attraction.
That's it.
Go over to Pop Jones.
He's hanging out in the warehouse.
He's got an old barn.
- Okay, thanks.
- I'm terribly sorry.
Broadway Bill was raised in a barn all his life.
- Good luck.
- Thank you very much.
What are we eating with?
When I'm hungry, I get hungry.
If you're hungry, eat.
You can't eat without it.
I'm not gonna do my stomach any good.
Where did we get the money to buy it?
We have to rely on the old man with the whiskers.
- Who's that?
- A miracle man.
When he puts his arm around you, the problems are over.
A good man to meet with.
Looks good, Pop.
We had pretty good horses here.
Yes?
- Who's the feedman here?
- Hey?
The food man?
- Feeding man?
- Yes.
Right here.
I want a supply of stuff sent in.
Oats, bran, barley, carrots and about 10 pounds of salt.
For cash or credit?
What do you mean?
Don't you trust me?
I don't know you.
I'll pay all my bills at the end of the week.
- I need cash...
- And some cribs, Pop.
- Hey?
- Some cribs.
-Shoot?
- Something you're sleeping on.
Sleep here?
You don't think...?
You don't know, but there's the winner of the Derby.
Do you think I'll leave him alone?
I'll show you how to clean up a bankroll.
The horse is a sleeper.
- A what?
- A sleeper.
Do you want a cot for the horse?
Do you hear Pop?
You're quite a kidder.
Come on, it's feeding time.
- White.
- Yes?
We have to go to the bank and make the deposit.
That's for sure.
Are you still here?
We need to get the food in.
Hurry up.
What was that?
He fell like a tree trunk.
But a little slow.
See his eyes?
The old man with the whiskers is already working.
Mr. Brooks!
I'm sure she's elegant.
Do you think Colonel Pettigrew will be impressed?
Colonel Pettigrew?
Who's that?
A gentleman, Whitey.
With great understanding and a soul.
A man you can borrow money from when he has it.
Borrowing?
When I borrowed, I was my old close, my run-down shoes.
- You have funny ideas.
- That's the secret.
Never look down and out, no matter how hungry you are.
You have the secret.
If he's got money, you'll get it.
All he has to do is look at the clothes.
Colonel Pettigrew.
I hope he's got 500 bucks.
Colonel Pettigrew?
- Yes?
Get your feet off my chair.
Yes, my dear.
A fortune.
Only by investing the sum of $50.
Stop dreaming.
Where do you get $50?
You can be very annoying.
Don't do us any good with the phone numbers you're throwing out.
- That's 5,000 you owe me.
- Double or nothing.
No, you don't.
Last season, I had you up to $80,000.
I switched, didn't I?
- For a dollar and a quarter.
- But in cash.
- Let's see if you can find a mistake.
- I read fairy tales at night.
It won't be when I get the 50.
Then get to work.
I'll have it without work.
Where'd you get that, vinegar?
Colonel Pettigrew.
- Yes, my dear.
A man who breeds horses...
Dan Brooks, a very good friend of mine.
Anyone who had $50 wouldn't be a friend of yours.
Dan Brooks has a thousand times 50 and never turned me down.
We're his guests at lunch today.
- He's buying us something to eat?
- At the Ritz Hotel.
Colonel!
My old and trusted friend!
Good to see you.
Meet my business partner Oscar McGuire, known as Happy.
This is Dan Brooks.
- How are you?
- How are you?
Come on, sit down.
- It's been a long time.
- Yes.
I'm a starving man.
Bring me the whole lunch.
I'll take the same, please.
Same for you, sir?
- I'm not here to give a speech.
- Right, sir.
Colonel, you look good.
I hear you're rolling in wealth.
No reason.
Don't believe all the stories you hear.
I talked to the boys and they agree.
You know they're exaggerating.
- What about you?
- Hold my own, that's all.
Don't be modest.
Race horses again, right?
Just hold my hand in it.
That's what I used to say about you.
I used to say,
Dan Brooks, a boy who gets through.
How long does it take?
He doesn't mind, Friday, the 13th.
Here's your soup and another soup.
I'm glad I met you, Dan.
I have a proposal to clean up $160,000, and I want you to be there.
- Really?
- Just for the old time's sake.
- That's nice of you.
- Nothing.
But I need some funding.
What do you need?
With a start of $50, I've got a bunch of...
You're not trying to borrow 50 bucks from me, are you?
Don't borrow, exactly.
Wait a minute.
I came here to borrow $500.
- Don't tell me you're broke?
- Yeah, totally.
- And you came...?
- That's right.
- And I came...?
- That's right.
That's the funniest thing!
What's funny about that?
- Are you all right?
- That's right.
- How broke are you?
- A real pauper.
Not even enough for the food?
- Nope.
What about you?
- Nope.
No, no, no!
Gentlemen, we're in a situation.
I haven't been thrown out of a place like this in years.
- Are you done, gentlemen?
- Yeah, that's right.
- Ready?
- Yes.
Waiter.
Come here.
What are you doing?
I'll never come here again!
I'm so sorry.
There they are, red-hot.
- You're a good dealer.
- It's not the size I wanted.
What kind of hamburger did you expect, a telephone pole?
I'm not kicking, but...
I should have a hat.
- I'll give you a Coke for the hat.
- I don't like Coke.
- A cake for the tie.
- Forget the tie.
- You have to eat dessert.
- Look.
Maybe we'll have dinner tonight.
Spades.
You should see me spit.
- Here we go.
- I'm a sight for sore eyes.
- Another hamburger for the spades.
- Maybe tonight.
Okay, dinner tonight for the hat, sparrows and tie.
Deal.
We have a little business.
Do you mind?
Oh, sure.
If you have anything for my wife...
Bring them in and we'll cut them open.
Smart guy, huh?
Now what?
Raising $500 isn't a breeze.
You're a big disappointment.
As you say, Broadway Bill must be a great animal.
If I can get him into this race.
Don't worry, it's as good as done.
My time and wisdom are dedicated to your well-being.
I'm sorry for you.
I got an ace in the hole, Edna.
50 to 1 shot.
You have to marry her first.
Who's Edna?
This vinegar-puss landlady in the pension.
Why does she want to marry you?
I encouraged them to be an economic necessity.
That gives you an idea of what I was driven to do.
Excited, my eye.
He'd rather make false love to her than go to work.
The problem is that he has a landlady in every city in the country.
It kept me in food and shelter for years.
And so are you.
Do you think she'd fall in love with a Ford truck?
That's a perfect pairing.
Quiet!
I'm not kidding, Happy.
I have a Ford truck I want to sell for $35.
But we need 500.
There will be small races tomorrow with $500 stakes.
If we win one, we'll be home.
Broadway Bill is a breeze.
We need $35 for spending. 10 for a jockey, 25 for the nomination.
An inspiration.
That's as good as in the bag.
Vinegar-Puss will have a Ford truck, even if I have to make the highest sacrifice.
What's going on?
- It's a long chance.
- I'm trying.
- Is that it?
Robust and reliable.
- What's going on?
- Does it look like a lawnmower?
Could be just as good.
Come on, darling, Broadway Bill's in the second race.
Oh, darling!
I couldn't think of you last night.
- You make so beautiful love!
- That's just the beginning.
Let's go.
Give them a lot from the beginning.
I can still hear her.
What's going on?
You've been there 10 minutes.
I'm having trouble with Broadway Bill.
Turn him around.
Hold him.
Go back.
Turn him around and bring him here.
- He's not finished yet.
- Sure he is.
Nervos in his first race.
He'll get away from them all.
Hold him!
Don't let him through.
Point 5.
The horse is half crazy.
Joe, we're going home.
That's the end of Broadway Bill in this race.
- Don't let him start over.
- All right.
Poor Dan.
I wonder what he's gonna do with Broadway Bill now.
- Hello, darling.
- Hello.
- That's a nice robe.
- Thank you very much.
- Any word from Dan?
