The astronomers are assembled in a large hall embellished with instruments.
The president and members of the committee enter.
Everybody takes his seat.
The scheme is approved by many. But one member violently opposes same.
After some argument, the president throws his papers and books at his head.
Upon order being restored, the trip proposed by the president is voted by acclimation.
The man-servants bring travelling suits.
We enter the interior of the workshop where smiths, mechanics, weighers, carpenters, upholsterers, et cetera are working hard at the completion of the machine.
Micromegas accidentally falls into a tub of nitric acid.
A workman informs the astronomers that if they would ascend to the roof, they will witness a splendid spectacle:
the casting of the gun.
Against the horizon, the chimneys are seen belching forth volumes of smoke.
Suddenly, the flag is hoisted.
At the signal, a mass of molten steel is directed from each furnace into the mold for the gun.
The mold pours forth flames and vapor.
On the top of the roofs of the town, pompous preparations have been made.
The shell is in position, ready to receive the travelers.
These arrive respond to the acclamations of the crowd and finally enter the shell.
A marine closes the bridge through which they have passed.
A number of gunners are pushing the shell up an incline into the mouth of the gun.
The bridge is closed.
Everyone is waiting for the signal which starts the shell on its voyage.
The gun is fired and the shell disappears into space.
The shell coming closer every minute, the moon magnifies rapidly until finally it attains colossal dimensions.
Suddenly, the shell pierces the eye of the moon.
The shell comes down with a crash.
The astronomers get out and are delighted at the landscape which is new to them.
Against the horizon, the Earth is rising slowly into space illuminating the picture with a fantastic light.
The astronomers see craters everywhere.
Just as they are about to explore, an explosion throws the unfortunate men violently in all directions.
They stretch themselves out on the ground and go to sleep.
Seven gigantic stars representing the Great Bear appear slowly, and out of the stars come faces of women who seem annoyed at the presence of these intruders in the moon.
Then, the stars are replaced by a lovely vision of Phoebes on the crescent, of Saturn in his globe and of charming young girls holding up a star.
They decide to punish the terrestrials in an exemplary manner. By order of Phoebes, snow is falling from all quarters, covering the ground with its white coat.
The cold becomes unbearable.
So the unfortunate voyagers wake up half-frozen.
They decide without hesitation and in spite of the danger to descend into the interior of the great crater in which they disappear one-by-one whilst the snowstorm is still raging.
The astronomers arrive into the interior of a most curious grotto filled with enormous mushrooms of every kind.
One of them opens his umbrella to compare its size with the mushroom, but the umbrella suddenly takes root and transforming itself into a mushroom starts growing attaining gigantic proportions.
The astronomers suddenly notice strange beings coming out from underneath the mushrooms while making singular contortions.
These are the Selenites, or inhabitants of the Moon.
A fantastical being rushes on an astronomer who defends himself and with a stroke of his umbrella the Selenite bursts into a thousand pieces.
But the Selenites are arriving in numbers.
The astronomers are captured, bound and taken to the palace of the King of the Selenites.
On a splendid throne, surrounded by living stars, the Selenite king is seated.
President Barbenfouillis makes a dash for the King of the Selenites and lifting him like a feather throws him violently on the ground.
The astronomers run away in the midst of the general disorder.
The astronomers run at full speed turning around each time they are pressed too closely and reducing the fragile beings to dust.
At last, the astronomers have found the shell and quickly shut themselves in the interior.
Thanks to the advance, they have succeeded in getting over their adversaries.
Only one, the president, has been left behind.
He rushes to the rope which hangs from the point of the shell and letting himself slide down the rope he gives it an impetus which causes the shell to fall off the edge of the moon.
The shell falls with sickening rapidity.
The sea appears.
The shell balances and thanks to the hermetically sealed air in its interior rises slowly to the surface.
The shell is picked up by a steamer which tows it to port.
The Mayor welcomes the astronomers with a speech, and the general ovation awaits their happy return.
The film, HAUNTED CASTLE (Schloss Vogeloed), was restored in 2002, using the following material:
an original negative of the Federal Film Archive, Berlin and a celluloid, tinted copy, with Portuguese intertitles from the Fundacao Cinemateca Brasileira, preserved in the Federal Film Archive in Koblenz.
Most intertitles were kept from the original negative and have been extended for reconstruction.
The missing intertitles were reconstructed using the script and a list of titles Decla-Bioscop filed on 31 March 1921.
The new intertitles used the original format And bear the logo FWMS.
The work was done in collaboration with the Federal Archive

But, alas, only fifteen minutes later ...
The day.
"His Reverence, Father Faramund, has just announced his arrival for tonight."

Nightfall.

"He wanted a saint ...
And he wanted to see in me only the qualities of a saint ..."
"So for months ...
I froze ... the purer he became, my attachment to the mundane seemed more terrible..."
"I was craving ... to do something evil ... wanting something evil ... "
"That's when I met Baron Safferstätt ...
"My husband wanted to give away all his possessions, and distribute his assets to the poor, and that brought many conflicts with his brother ... until, one night, a complete breakup occurred."

My husband ... was shot dead."

"I have informed the authorities of my suspicions about this Count Oetsch...!"
A happy man.
"She is so strange... she doesn't say a thing, even not about the Father who disappeared?"
At noon.
"Have you ever murdered anyone?"
"What ... did you say ... that?"
"Gentlemen!
Why not let me finish speaking?"
"Last night I had a dream!"
"Count Oetsch!
"Believe me, my investigating eye is experienced!"
"...and yet, Count Oetsch is involved in the Father's disappearance."
"He is acting so superior in order to conceal his new crime."
"He will have to apologize for his inappropriate joke in the presence of all the guests!"
"You absolutely have to speak to him.
"You already know everything, Sir!"
"Perhaps you also know who is suspected of causing the Father's disappearance?" causing the Father's disappearance?"
"Me!"
"But, I know even more, Mr. Ex-Justice.
I also know how to discover secrets."
"To give you an example, I am now going to give away one of the Baron's secrets."
"Count Oetsch!
"My compliments for your opinion!
I just want to whisper a few words into Baron Safferstätt's ears."
"No. ... no ...
I am ... not a murderer."
"What are these suggestions?"
"Do you perhaps suddenly accuse the Baron of the assassination of your brother?"
"Perhaps?"
"I will question Baron Safferstätt."
"Today I'll find out!"
He murdered my husband ...!
He shot his own brother during an argument!
End of the Fourth Act.

Fifth Act
Half an hour later.
"What do you know of that day, my dear - speak!"
"My Lord, the Count, preferred to run away!""
"And so I tell you, he has the disappearance of the Father also on his conscience."
"Father Faramund... has returned again!"
"Yesterday I was seeking comfort, and you did not come!
- I will make my confession to you!"
"Because you, as a priest, must keep silent!"
"We must not do anything now!
The events of these last days will now probably clear up!"
"A few days before the murder of my husband ... "
"I am appalled at such holiness ...!"
"I'd like to see something evil ... something very very evil!"
"A murder ... !"
"Baron Safferstätt, burning with passion for me, had terribly misunderstood me!"
"He killed my husband!"
"He confessed to me two days later."
"Then I realized I was guilty. "
"The Count was arrested.
We would have been poisoned ... to prove his innocence ... "
"But, he was not convicted!"
"Thus accursed, both of us! Fearing life!
Fearing death. "
Tied together by our guilt!"
We got married!
That is our marriage!"
"So we became two comrades!
"I implicated Count Oetsch in the murder of his own brother!"
"I have followed my destiny so far!"
"Now you know everything!
And you must remain silent!"
I ... I understand!"
"Act like a man!"
"I ... was ... not happy ..."
"A shot ...?"
Evening peace.
"His struggles are over!"
"I, who was innocently accused, had always guessed..."
"So, some way had to be found for me finally to clear myself from this ignominious suspicion!"
"So, I arrived before Father Faramund, who was also expected at the castle!" Thus I came to the castle to await Father Faramund!"
"We have to beg your pardon for so many things!"
Nightfall.
"I am Father Faramond of Rome."

PARIS ASLEEP
One evening, Paris went to sleep and the following morning the night watchman in the Eiffel Tower wonders why not a thing is stirring in the city and since no one comes...
CHI EF OF POLICE
At the Paris airport.
"Everything came to a standstill last night except for me up in the Eiffel Tower."
"And us in our plane."
A thief always comes in handy.
"We mustn't let it get us down!"
"I'll see that every shop is open for you even the Bank of France!"
Paris is all theirs.
But what good are riches when you're bored?
"If anyone's listening please come to...
A handkerchief in the window."
"This is where the powerful rays came from that put everyone to sleep."
"It's my uncle, Professor X!"
"You must wake everyone up!"
"I never thought of that!"
"I'll give it a try."
"It's 3:25 a.m., the same time."
"You betrayed me!"
"We're going to make some money... thanks to your uncle's invention."
"The whole city was asleep for four days."
"You all say the same thing!"
"We're all telling the truth."
"Go tell your tales somewhere else."
"Did we dream this whole thing up?"
"No, it wasn't a dream!"
At the beginning of the Middle Ages the legend of the mandrake was born.
According to legend, a root was transformed into a human being.
We have to go out at night to find the root, when the clock strikes midnight.
You should place the stick into the ground below the gallows.
The root of the mandrake, with its strength and Magic brought fortune to men, but misfortune and pain.
His Excellency, Professor Jakob ten Brink was famous for his ability to experiment with the hereditary character of man.
During my studies, I have found the legend of the mandrake, and now I look at this old superstition scientifically.
We know the wind carries pollen from flower to flower ... without any will, without a certain goal.
And thus was born in the laboratory the animal laboratory.
I wanted to discover:
Is character inherited from the parents or just by chance?
I always say to my students:
We should overcome the road open for experiments Teacher's Voronoff. XXX
Above all, we should pay attention to the results.
Because then we open new possibilities for the study of humanity.
Franz Braun, nephew of the teacher.
Wouldn't these men just mock you, uncle?
On the contrary!
It would be the biggest experiment of my life:
Creating a man in the laboratory.
A being with a hereditary character that does not come influenced by the parents.
The woman must be of the same qualities as the land fertilized under the gallows, the "mandrake" must come from the dregs of society
While the prison administration got a man for the professor,
Franz Braun was looking for women for his uncle needed to perfect the experiment.
Alraune, daughter of sin ... from the dark days of superstition.
Franz Baum his uncle was looking for the ideal woman he needed for his experiment
Forget that your plan violates nature, the finest of life ...
Beware: the legend of the mandrake is real!
It will become a living being, but it lacks the warmth of life, and bears the cold of death inside.
I tell you, the legend of the mandrake is true. It is a living being that lacks the warmth of life and bears the cold of death within itself. Be on guard consequences of your action ...
Nature will have her revenge!
Alraune be educated at school Convent of the Sacred-Heart.
I cannot do this to my parents!
I want to do everything you want.
On the bank of the Industry and Credit.
Mom sends you greetings.
And the Mandrake?
The evolution of Mandrake.
24 October 1908 It is a success, with the help of my nephew, the creation of a Mandrake root.
He is a dreamer, I, by contrast, am a man of science ... I am above prejudice.
According to legend, the mandrake brings fortune and wealth.
Today I have selected a name: Alraune ten Brink.
It is blasphemy ... and you will be punished.
Alraune disappears without a trace ...
-School of the Sacred Heart convent.
I want champagne!
At one stop, Alraune lies for the first time to people from a traveling circus.
Aren't you afraid of a mouse?
After months of investigation, Alraune ten Brink was found.
In the end, I knew I would succeed.
Alraune, doesn't it embarrass you?
I'm scared of you.
You used to be my nephew.
We moved away until your story was forgotten.
Enough of this visit by a gentleman.
Who do you think is your father?
I offend, Alraune.
If you knew where you came from!
... and then presented in high society.
Father, come here!
Surprisingly, father, we seem so little alike.
Do I look more like my mother?
Yes ... I think of your mother often.
What if she looks like her mother?
Never!
Dear lady, I want to ask the professor for you hand.
Sorry, sir ...
Alraune is yet very young and should remain with me.
Tonight at eleven I flee with her.
What a shame ... An experiment by a cynical scientist ... a daughter of vice and crime.
What is my place among men?
I play him.
I get even with him.
You are right ... I stayed with him.
Dear Dad, I think you're jealous.
His letter was brought to me here.
In the diary of my "father" I read everything that happened before my birth.
Have mercy on me ...
I want to know everything.
I'll give you everything you want, but we go from here.
Alraune ... you and me ...
You're a cheater! What were you thinking? I have now learned that this woman is not you daughter.
I cannot deceive you.
You must stay with me, or I will kill you ...
Dear Professor!
It is as if a ghost followed you ... as if a devil wanted to harm another.
All speculation has failed ...
She has destroyed ...
Come to the gaming table, Alraune.
You will bring me luck.
Play red, the color of good fortune.
Red five times in a row.
Place your bets!
For the ninth time the ball has landed on red.
I want to leave.
We have not lost everything yet, Alraune.
We still have your jewels.
We have not lost everything, Alraune.
We still have your jewelry.
Yes ... but not with you ...
Take me out of here ...
Give me another soul, a heart ... and I will become a human being and love as a human being.
Alraune began a new life together the one she loved.
And the one who violated the laws of nature, fell into a hell of loneliness and insanity.
-Thirty thousand.
- From the Russians?
No, from the French.
From the Russians we capture more than that every day.
Mr. Postman.
War is war and schnapps is schnapps, and business must go on.
You didn't leave the mail yet this morning.
Ah, I'm sorry, Mr. Meyer.
Hello, Himmelstoss.
Anything for us today?
- No, no, Master Peter.
- Oh, there must be something.
Here, here you go, young lad.
There.
This is the last mail I deliver anyhow.
- What?
- Tomorrow I change uniforms.
- You're going in the army?
- Yes, I was called.
I'm a sergeant in the reserves, you know.
I'll be called myself, if it doesn't end in a few months.
- It will, though.
- I'm sure you're right, Mr. Meyer.
Now, my beloved class, this is what we must do:
Strike with all our power.
Give every ounce of strength... to win victory before the end of the year.
It is with reluctance that I bring this subject up again.
You are the life of the fatherland, you boys.
You are the iron men of Germany.
You are the gay heroes who will repulse the enemy... when you are called upon to do so.
It is not for me to suggest that any of you... should stand up and offer to defend his country. But I wonder if such a thing is going through your heads.
I know that in one of the schools, the boys have risen up in the classroom... and enlisted in a mass.
But, of course, if such a thing should happen here, you would not blame me for a feeling of pride.
Perhaps some will say... that you should not be allowed to go yet, that you are too young, that you have homes, mothers, fathers, that you should not be torn away.
Are your fathers so forgetful of their fatherland... that they would let it perish rather than you?
Are your mothers so weak that they cannot send a son... to defend the land which gave them birth?
And after all, is a little experience... such a bad thing for a boy?
Is the honor of wearing a uniform... something from which we should run?
And if our young ladies glory in those who wear it, is that anything to be ashamed of?
I know you have never desired the adulation of heroes.
That has not been part of my teaching.
We have sought to make ourselves worthy, and let a claim come when it would.
But to be foremost in battle... is a virtue not to be despised.
I believe it will be a quick war, that there will be few losses.
But if losses there must be, then let us remember the Latin phrase... which must have come to the lips of many a Roman... when he stood embattled in a foreign land:
"Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori."
"Sweet and fitting it is to die for the fatherland."
Some of you may have ambitions.
I know of one young man who has great promise as a writer, and he has written the first act of a tragedy... which would be a credit to one of the masters.
And he is dreaming, I suppose, of following in the footsteps of Goethe and Schiller, and I hope he will.
But now our country calls.
The fatherland needs leaders.
Personal ambition must be thrown aside... in the one great sacrifice for our country.
Here is a glorious beginning to your lives.
The field of honor calls you.
Why are we here?
You, Kropp, what has kept you back?
You, Mueller, you know how much you are needed?
Ah, I see you look at your leader.
And I, too, look to you, Paul Baumer, and I wonder what you are going to do.
- I'll go.
- I want to go.
- Me too.
- I'm ready.
- I'm not gonna stay home!
Follow me!
Enlist now!
- No more classes!
- Don't be a quitter!
- Come on, Behn!
Stick together. That's what we've got to do.
- Let's all stick together.
- Come on, Behn.
All right.
All right. - I'll go.
- That's the way!
Let's go!
Let's sing! Come on!
- Keep in line there, soldiers.
- Anything you say, General.
Detail, halt!
Left face!
Get into uniform, ready to report.
Fall out!
I betcha a place like this gets you in good condition.
You have to be for the long marches.
I'm gonna get in the cavalry and ride.
No cavalry for me.
Infantry's where you see the fighting.
Where are all the guns?
That's what I want to know.
Oh, you don't get a gun for a long while yet.
If I'm gonna bump off the enemy, I gotta have some practice.
Bayonet drill. That's what I want.
Ah!
You won a medal that time, Mueller.
You wait.
In about a month I'll be covered with 'em.
Say, keep your boots out of my face!
Why, it's an honor to have those boots in your face.
They're the best pair in the army!
My uncle gave 'em to me.
Just look at that special imported leather.
Put 'em anyplace you like, except in my face.
Not even a kitchen maid'll look at me in this!
Attention!
Well, for the love of -- It's Himmelstoss!
- So it is.
- And all dressed up.
Hello, Himmie.
You didn't think you'd see me again so soon, did you?
- You see my rank?
- Sure.
Fall back, then!
- Himmelstoss, we certainly are glad to see you.
- What did you say?
- I was going to say-- - Never mind!
- What's the matter with you?
- When you address your superior officer, say "sir"!
- Where'd he get such a nice uniform?
- Any mail for us, Himmie?
- Quiet!
- My dear fellow, you're shouting.
Ah, come on, Himmelstoss. We know ya.
Take off the false whiskers.
- I believe you mean it!
- You'll find out that I mean it.
- But only three days ago you were our postman.
- Silence!
Come back here!
Line up!
Line up!
Get in some kind of a line!
All of you!
Line up, I say!
What a pretty sight that is!
Have you never heard of standing in line?
You make a fine mess of it.
Well, I'll have to teach you.
We'll spend the whole day on it, huh?
You may be stupid, but I'm used to that.
And then there'll be plenty of other things too.
Oh, I'll not neglect you.
You're not much to begin with, but I'll do my best.
I see that we have come here with a slight misunderstanding, and we'll correct that, too, won't we, huh?
And the first thing to do is to forget everything you ever knew.
Everything you ever learned, forget! See?
Forget what you've been and what you think you're going to be.
You're going to be soldiers, and that's all!
I'll take the mother's milk out of you!
I'll make you hard-boiled!
I'll make soldiers out of you or kill you!
Now... salute!
A-ten-hut!
Detachment... lie down!
Head down!
Keep your head down, Baumer!
Detachment... get up!
Now sing!
Do you call that singing?
Detachment, halt!
So... we have no spirit, huh?
We are in no mood for recreation.
Work is what we want.
Good! Then we'll go back to work!
Detachment, lie down!
Keep your head down!
Now sing!
Men... halt!
Order, arms!
Inspection at 3:00.
Dismissed!
Oh, that swine!
That means we get no time off.
It will take four hours to get ready for inspection.
- I'd like to know what's in his mind.
- He hasn't got any!
I'm gonna cut him open sometime and find out!
He's too thick-skinned.
He won't cut.
This is the fourth time he's made me disappoint that poor girl.
Arms!
Order, arms!
Left shoulder, arms!
Squad right.
To the right, march!
Left, left, left, left.
Follow right, march!
Squad, left march!
Forward... march!
Detachment... halt!
Present arms!
Himmelstoss.
Excellent work.
They're going up front tomorrow.
- I recommend leave till midnight.
- Very good, sir.
Detachment...
Crawl forward!
He spoiled our leave.
I'll never forgive him for that.
- The rat!
- Leave till midnight.
Hmm! It'll take till midnight to dry our clothes.
There goes the filthy ape now.
While we slave over this mud, he goes off to have a few drinks!
Someday I'm going to take one smack at him-- just one.
Me too.
That's gonna be my life's work from now on.
Why only one?
I'm gonna take several.
I might even kick him while he's down.
I feel mean.
What are you doing?
You're not going to desert, are you?
What?
Listen. I've got an idea.
Crawl forward!
Lie down!
Lie down! Crawl forward!
- Cover!
- Paul, you all right?
Behn! Behn!
Come on! Behn, come on!
You fool!
Behn!
Get up! Come on.
- Sounds like more replacements coming in.
Yeah.
Tjaden must have gone home for that wood.
There's some more, fresh from the turnip patch.
I suppose this is where we bunk.
That's me, "l. Westhus,"
and this is where I live.
- I didn't know!
- Well, you know now!
Yes. Yes, of course.
- It's all right.
- Here's a bunk, Paul.
- When did we eat last?
- Don't remind me.
- I was fine until you spoke. - Where are we anyway?
I don't know.
The name on the railroad station's been shot off.
There must be something to eat somewhere.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll ask those fellas.
Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Westhus.
Oh. Meet Detering.
A better farmer never lived.
- And Mr. Tjaden.
- Sit down.
You see, we haven't eaten since breakfast.
We thought maybe you could tell us what we ought to do about it.
Eat without further delay.
Well, what's funny about that?
This is a bad town to bring an appetite to, soldier.
We've been here since yesterday morning, living on baled hay and razor blades.
We're willing to buy our food.
Where's the canteen?
The only canteen in these regions is out looking for supplies.
- Ever hear of Katczinsky?
- Who?
Katczinsky.
He's uncanny.
If there's any food within 25 miles, he'll be the one to get it.
Attention!
- What is this?
- Volunteers for the future generals' staff.
Sometime I'm gonna take one of you volunteers apart... and find out what makes you leave school and join the army.
At ease.
This is no parade ground.
- Hungry? - Yes.
Wait! Wait a minute!
That's no invitation.
Can you pay?
I have some money.
No, not money.
That's just pieces of paper.
Have you got any cigarettes, cigars, - or soap, cognac-- - Yeah, yeah.
Are you crazy?
There ain't enough here for us.
I wish you three would get bumped off.
I'm tired of feeding ya for nothing.
- Bring everything you got.
- I'd be glad to give you-- - Come on!
- Is this enough, sir?
- Kat! - Hmm? - You've got the wiring detail tonight.
- Where? - Past the graveyard.
- With this bunch?
It's quiet tonight.
You can teach 'em a couple of things.
Thanks.
I'd rather do it alone.
- These babes get killed off too fast.
- Well, the lorry's waiting.
Last night I was too hungry to sleep, and tonight, when I get the wrinkles out of my gut, they think up wiring duty.
Well, here's your chance, heroes.
For the fatherland!
Come on, get your stuff and let's get out of here.
- Is that any way to drive?
- Let him drive any way he wants.
Suppose he breaks your arm.
You get sent home, don't you?
A lot better than havin' a hole in your guts.
If there's any of you left, I'll pick you up in the morning.
Well, if that ride you gave us didn't kill us, nothing will.
- And be on time.
I don't want to miss my breakfast.
- You better wait for your army, Papa.
Here, here. Don't be so backward.
Listen, children. All we got to do is to string a little wire.
We pick it up at the dump and carry it to where we need it.
Now, you're gonna see some shell fire, and you're gonna be scared, see?
It's all right, boy.
Get up.
Here.
Never mind.
It's happened to better men than you, and it's happened to me.
When we come back, I'll get you all some nice clean underwear.
That kind of shell you don't have to pay much attention to.
Those big fellas just make a lot of noise and land about five miles behind the line.
The things we've got to watch out for are the light ones.
They don't give you much warning.
They go "waa-aa-aah zing."
And when you hear that, down!
Mother Earth.
Press yourselves down upon her.
Bury yourselves deep into her.
Just keep your eyes on me.
When you see me flop, you flop, only try to beat me to it.
Now listen.
I'll show you how it's done.
Give me a couple of those.
That's to kill the noise.
Tjaden.
See that?
- What's that mean?
- Bombardment.
My eyes!
I'm blind!
I can't see!
God!
- My eyes!
I can't see!
- I can't see! - It's Behn!
It's Behn!
- I'll go get him--
- You'll get killed!
- Let me--
- Lay down and stay there!
He's dead.
- Why did you risk your life bringing' him in?
But it's Behn!
- My friend.
- He's a corpse, no matter who it is.
Now, don't any of you ever do that again.
Put him over there.
- Mind the wire.
All right, come on. Get your packs and fall in.
Hurry up!
Come on. Hurry up.
Get your packs and fall in.
Kat, what are we doing?
What's happening?
You heard him.
Orders to march.
- But where to, for the love of -- - Another party.
And this one is gonna last a long time.
Come on.
Here we go.
Company, attention!
Shoulder arms!
March right, march!
- Take your hands off that!
- Queen takes it!
- Well, if you think that's a queen, look again.
Ah, it's a jack.
- Yeah. - Honest, these cards all look alike.
It's too noisy!
I can't play.
- I suppose your delicate nerves can't stand it.
That's Oscar.
The son of a--
Look at that!
Don't be so snooty.
You may wish you had this back.
About two more days of this... and this rat-bitten end of a piece of bread's gonna taste like a hunk of fruitcake.
It wouldn't- - It wouldn't last two more days, would it?
Didn't I tell you this was gonna be a bad one?
I don't mind the days so much. It's keeping up all night--
Ah, two more days makes a week, kid.
Then you can say you've been under fire!
You're not scared, are you?
No.
I was just asking.
- Wanna play some more?
- Do you?
- Sure.
- All right. My deal.
You better get your boot back before Oscar eats that!
- The kid's all right.
Yeah, yeah.
Let him sleep. He's dreamin'.
Oh, God.
Can't you see it's Behn?
He didn't want to come to war!
No, no. It isn't Behn.
It isn't Behn!
It's Kemmerick! It's me!
Shut up, will you?
It's bad enough in here as it is. Every--
Everything's all right, Franz.
You're dreaming.
You're just dreaming, I guess.
- Attention!
- At ease.
The barrage is gettin' worse.
The men in two more dugouts gone.
However, we'll do our best to get some food up here by evening.
Stop! Stop!
Let me out!
- What did you do that for?
- Shut up!
Grab him.
- Now hold him.
You all right now?
I think so.
I couldn't hold out much longer.
- Oh, God, it's Franz!
- Get him over there!
No, he's been hit in the stomach.
He can't have anything to drink.
Get a stretcher.
Where'd they get you, Kemmerick?
- Here it is, sir.
- Take his head.
All right. Take him out.
- Is it serious, sir?
- I'm not sure.
- Tell the others he's all right.
- Yes, sir.
If we're going to fight, why don't we fight?
Why don't we go over?
You could go crazy staying here.
Let's do something!
- Let's go after 'em!
- Sit down!
If that cook of ours had any guts, he'd try to bring something through.
He's so far behind the lines he can't hear the shooting!
- Here's Kat.
Get anything?
- Any luck?
- We'll have to split this up among us.
- Something to eat!
We need butter too.
Yes.
And dessert.
And a feather bed to sleep on.
- Rats!
Get out of the way!
What's that?
- Come on!
Grab your rifles!
- Here they come.
- Get your grenades here.
Hurry up.
Come on, hurry up.
Let's go!
Back to your own lines!
- Fill it up.
- And hurry up.
I've got other things to do.
I've been waiting for this for three weeks.
When they all get here.
What do you want?
Beans, you homely-lookin' son of a frog's leg. - What do you think I want?
I'll feed you when you're all here.
- We're all here now.
- Only half the company's here.
Get the rest.
- Wake 'em up.
I wish I could wake 'em up.
There's 80 of us left.
The rest is in dressing stations or pushing' up daisies.
Eighty?
And I cooked for 150!
All right. We'll have enough for once.
Come on. Dish out!
You mean you've cooked beans for 150... and you've got bread for 150... and sausage for 150, and tobacco for 150?
Everything!
It's all wrong.
I should have been notified.
What a feast!
- Everyone gets two issues.
- Get back in line!
Get back in line! - Oh, no! That won't do.
I can't give 80 men what's meant for 150.
Listen. You drew rations for the 2nd Company, didn't ya?
Yeah.
All right. We're the 2nd Company.
- I've got my orders.
- Kat's right.
- We're the 2nd Company.
And if only half of us get back, that's our good luck.
- Come on. Dish it out. - Come on!
- No!
You're the yellowest baboon that ever drew a cook wagon, and you're scared-- it shows.
All we want to hear out of you is one more little yip, and we'll cut ya up and eat ya raw.
Why, you keep your kitchen so far back of the lines, we never get anything to eat until it's cold and we're asleep!
Now, you low-down rat, get out... - or we wreck the joint!
- Come on! Give us-- - Attention!
At ease.
What's goin' on here?
He's cooked for 150, sir, and he only wants to give us half.
- Looks pretty good.
- Yes, sir.
- Serve the whole issue.
The men can use it.
- Yes, sir.
- And bring me a plate too.
- Yes, sir. All right. Take it all.
Take everything.
Give 'em honey.
Give 'em what they want.
- Fill it up!
-Don't mind me. -Oh, that's all right.
Don't mention it.
You know...
I could do with some more beans.
Go help yourself.
There's more over there.
- It's too far.
- I wonder, when are we going back to the front?
It's enough to take away a man's appetite.
You know, if they're gonna march us in again tomorrow, we ought to go see how Kemmerick is. - That's a good idea.
- Let's do that.
- How far is the dressing station?
- About two miles. - We could take his things to him.
- Good.
It seemed rotten to think of a thing like that happening to him, a nice fellow like Kemmerick.
Ah, the French certainly deserve to be punished for starting this war.
Everybody says it's somebody else.
Well, how do they start a war?
Well, one country offends another.
How could one country offend another?
You mean there's a mountain over in Germany gets mad at a field over in France?
- Well, stupid, one people offends another.
Oh, if that's it, I shouldn't be here at all.
I don't feel offended.
It don't apply to tramps like you.
Good. Then I can be going home right away.
- Ah, you just try it.
- Yeah. You wanna get shot?
- The kaiser and me--
Me and the kaiser felt just alike about this war.
We didn't either of us want any war, so I'm going home.
- He's there already.
- Somebody must have wanted it.
Maybe it was the English.
No, I don't want to shoot any Englishmen.
I never saw one till I came up here.
And I suppose most of them never saw a German till they came up here.
- No, I'm sure they weren't asked about it.
- No. Well... it must be doing somebody some good.
- Not me and the kaiser.
- I think maybe the kaiser wanted a war.
You leave us out of this!
I don't see that.
The kaiser's got everything he needs.
Well, he never had a war before.
Every full-grown emperor needs one war to make him famous.
- Why, that's history. - Yeah, generals too. They need war.
- And manufacturers. They get rich.
I think it's more a kind of fever.
Nobody wants it in particular, and then all at once, there it is.
We didn't want it.
The English didn't want it.
And here we are fighting.
I'll tell you how it should all be done.
Whenever there's a big war comin' on, - you should rope off a big field--
- And sell tickets. Yeah.
And--
And on the big day, you should take all the kings and their cabinets and their generals, put them in the center dressed in their underpants, and let 'em fight it out with clubs.
The best country wins.
Well, now that Kat's settled everything, let's go see Kemmerick.
- Something interesting might happen on the way.
- Might cheer him up. Boys, me and the kaiser want you back in time to march tomorrow.
Don't forget.
- We'll be back. - Give the boy my regards.
There he is.
- Hello, Kemmerick.
- How's it going?
How are things going?
Are they looking after you all right?
How are they treating you?
They're robbers here.
Robbers.
They stole my watch!
I always told you, nobody should carry as good a watch as that.
- They took it while I was under ether!
- Franz, you'll get it back.
Do you feel all right?
- Just look at my hand.
- That's because you lost so much blood.
- Just eat decently and you'll get well again.
- Oh, no. You must eat.
That's the main thing.
It looks good too.
I have such a terrible pain in my foot.
Every toe on my right foot hurts.
Well, how can your foot hurt when your leg's been--
I know what you mean!
I know! I know now!
They cut my leg off.
Why didn't they tell me?
- Why didn't they tell me?
- Franz!
Franz! - Now I can't walk anymore!
You must be thankful that you've come off with only that.
I wanted to be a forester once.
You can yet.
They make artificial legs that are wonderful.
And you're through too.
You can go home.
Think of that.
We brought your things for you.
See? Put 'em under the bed.
That's a marvelous pair of boots.
Look at that leather!
What comfort.
I was just thinking.
If you're not going to be using these, Franz, why don't you leave 'em with us?
What good are they to you?
I can use 'em.
My boots give me blister after blister--
Well, we'll be going, Franz.
Oh, don't go.
Stay just a little while longer.
- I'll come right back.
- We'll be coming soon again, Franz.
- I know you'll be feeling better.
- Bye. - Bye.
- Good-bye, Franz.
You think he'll last till after mess?
- I don't think--
- Done for.
Boys, you go along.
I'll see you later.
Good-bye.
All right, Paul.
I'm sorry, Paul.
I wouldn't touch a thing of his if he could use it.
I'd go barefoot over barbed wire for him if it'd do him any good.
Only- - Only why should some orderly get those boots?
I understand, Mueller.
We're all alike out here.
And good boots are scarce.
Tell the doctor to come, please.
Doctor, the man in the next bed would like to see you, sir.
I've done everything I can for him.
There's no helping him.
Poor little fella.
He says next time, Franz.
Do you think I'll ever get well?
Why, of course.
- Do you really think so?
- Sure, once you get over the operation.
I don't think so.
Franz!
Don't talk nonsense.
Why, you'll be as good as new.
They fix up worse things than that.
Perhaps you'll go to the convalescent home... in Klosterberg among the villagers.
Then you can look out of the windows, across the fields... to the two trees on the horizon.
The loveliest time of the year now when the corn ripens.
You can go out without asking anyone.
You can even play piano if you want to.
Oh- - Oh, but, Franz, you must try to sleep now.
O God, this is Franz Kemmerick, only 19 years old.
He doesn't want to die.
Please don't let him die.
Take my boots home for Mueller.
Oh, no, Franz, no.
And if... Paul... you find my watch, send it home.
Doctor.
Doctor! Where's the doctor?
Why isn't there a doctor here?
- Doctor, come quick. Franz Kemmerick is dying!
- Which one is that?
- Amputated leg. - I've amputated a dozen legs today.
- Bed 26, sir.
- You see to it.
I'm due in the operating room.
One operation after another since 5:00 this morning.
Sixteen dead today, and yours is the 17th.
There'll probably be 20 by the morning.
What's your hurry?
Hey! I'll bet he stole those boots!
- I got it, Kat. - Hmm?
Listen: "The sum of an arithmetic series... is S = A + L x N over 2."
- lnteresting, isn't it?
- What do you wanna learn that stuff for?
One day you'll stop a bullet and it'll all be worthless.
- I get a lot of fun out of it.
My boots!
Mueller.
I saw him die.
I didn't know what it was like to die before.
And then-- then I came outside... and it felt-- it felt so good to be alive that I started in to walk fast.
I began to think of the strangest things, like being out in the fields.
Things like that.
You know-- girls.
And it felt as if there were... something electric running from the ground up through me.
And I started.
I began to run hard.
I passed soldiers and I heard voices calling to me.
I ran and I ran.
I felt as if I couldn't breathe enough air into me.
And-- And now I'm hungry.
I don't mind the war now.
Be a pleasure to go to the front in boots like these.
It's a good invention just the same.
If you crack each separate louse, think of all the energy you use up. Watch.
Burned to death.
- How was patrol? Bad?
- Must've been terrible if they had time to gather the harvest.
We passed a cherry tree and when he saw it, he went crazy.
I could hardly drag him away.
It was... beautiful.
I have a big orchard with cherry trees at home.
When they're in full blossom, from the hayloft it looks like one single sheet.
So white.
- Perhaps you can get leave soon.
- You may even be sent back as a farmer.
A woman can't run a farm alone. That's no good, you know?
No matter how hard she works.
Harvest coming on again.
What's the matter with him?
Got a letter yesterday from his wife.
He wants to get back to his farm.
We'd all like to get back home.
I wonder what we'd do if it were suddenly peacetime again?
Get drunk and look for women!
I'd go looking for a Cinderella... that could wear this for a garter.
And when I'd found her, nobody'd see me for two weeks.
I'll go back to the peat fields... and those pleasant hours in the beer gardens.
And there's worse things than cobbling too.
Look.
My family.
I oughta give you a kick in the backside for startin' all this.
It's all right for all you to talk.
You've got something to go back to:
wives, children, jobs.
But what about us? What have we got to go back to?
- School?
- Why not?
You know everything already.
A man can't take all that rubbish they teach you seriously... after three years of shells and bombs.
- You can't peel that off easily.
- They never taught us anything really useful, like how to light a cigarette in the wind or make a fire out of wet wood... or bayonet a man in the belly instead of the ribs where it gets jammed.
What can happen to us afterwards?
I'll tell ya.
Take our class.
Out of 20, three are officers, nine dead,
Mueller and three others wounded... and one in the madhouse.
We'll all be dead someday, so let's forget it.
Hurry up! Get in there!
Hurry up!
Himmelstoss!
What's up?
- What are you, crazy?
- It's Himmelstoss! Himmelstoss?
There is justice in the army!
Well, well.
So, we are all here, huh?
-A bit longer than you, Himmie.
-Since when have we become so familiar?
Stand up and click your heels together! All of you!
- Take a running jump at yourself!
- Who's your friend?
Would somebody get General Ludendorff a nice, comfortable chair?
I command you as your superior officer!
- Do you want to be court-martialed?
- I do! There's going to be a big attack tonight and I'd just love to get out of it.
Will you obey my orders?
Kiss my butt!
It isn't customary to ask for salutes here. But I'll tell you what we'll do.
We're going to attack a town that we tried to take once before.
Many killed and many wounded.
It was great fun.
This time you're going with us.
If any of us stops a bullet, before we die... we're going to come to you, click our heels together and ask stiffly,
- "Please, Sergeant Himmelstoss, may we go?"
- You'll--
You'll pay for this, you--
There it is.
Better get ready, boys.
I'm wounded!
I'm wounded!
It's just a scratch, you yellow rat! Up!
Get out with the others!
- Up! - No!
No! No!
You yellow rat!
Stinking yellow rat!
Let the others do it, eh?
Get up! Get up!
- Aa-aah!
- Get up! Forward!
- Get out here!
- Command... was forward.
Forward!
Counterattack.
I want to help you.
Stop it, stop it.
I can bear the rest of it.
I can't listen to that!
Why do you take so long dying?
You're going to die anyway!
Oh, no. You won't die. Oh, no.
You won't die.
They're only little wounds. You'll get home.
You'll be all right.
You'll get home long before I will.
You know I can't run away. That's why you accuse me.
I tell you, I didn't want to kill you.
I tried to keep you alive.
If you jumped in here again, I wouldn't do it.
When you jumped in here you were my enemy, and I was afraid of you.
But you're just a man like me, and I killed you.
Forgive me, comrade.
Say that for me.
Say you forgive me.
Oh, no.
You're dead.
You're better off than I am.
You're through.
They can't do any more to you now.
Oh, God, why did they do this to us?
We only wanted to live, you and I.
Why should they send us out to fight each other?
If we threw away these rifles and these uniforms, you could be my brother just like Kat and Albert.
You'll have to forgive me, comrade.
I'll do all I can.
I'll write to your parents. I'll write to--
I'll write to your wife.
I'll write to her.
I promise she'll not want for anything.
I'll help her and your parents too.
Only forgive me.
Forgive me!
Terrible thing happened yesterday.
I stabbed a man.
With my own hands, stabbed him.
I know how it is.
Your first time.
Never mind.
The stretcher-bearers will find him.
- He's dead.
I watched him die.
- You couldn't do anything about it.
We have to kill.
We can't help it.
That's what we are here for.
Uh- - Look there, for instance.
That got him.
You should've seen how he leaped in the air.
That fellow had to shoot with us for today with three hits.
If he keeps it up, he'll have a decoration for his buttonhole this evening.
Don't you lose any more sleep over this business.
Maybe it was 'cause I was out there with him so long, huh?
Sure, that's it.
After all, war is war.
Forward, march!
Quick there!
Forward!
Company... halt!
Dismissed!
Uncommissioned officers, enlisted men, dismiss!
- Give me your best sausage.
- Two.
Give me a beer.
One, two, three!
Hey, come on.
A beer.
Hey, get out of here!
Come on. Give me a beer.
A beer.
One b--
Here's hoping we get falling-down drunk tonight.
Here's how it started.
I'd forgotten there were girls like that.
There aren't.
Just look at those thin, little shoes.
She couldn't march many miles in those.
Paul!
Don't speak about marching.
You're boring the young lady.
A thousand pardons.
- How old do you think she is?
- Oh, about 22.
No, that'd make her older than us.
She's... 17.
A girl like that.
That'd be good, eh, Albert?
We wouldn't have much of a chance with him around.
- We could take a bath, wash our clothes--
- All right.
and I might even go so far as to get deloused.
Wait a minute!
She's a long way from here now.
Look at the date.
May, 1917.
- Four months ago.
- That's true.
Well, here's to her anyway.
Here's to 'em all, everywhere.
Albert, - we might as well wash up anyway.
- All right.
Personally, I like 'em bigger around.
This conversation was on a high moral plane up to now.
Now we do need a bath.
- A bath?
- For what?
You wouldn't understand.
This water is freezing.
This romantic business has gone too far.
- Ahh, but think of her beautiful eyes! - Oh!
Oh, and her hair.
- Here we are!
- We're not gonna miss a thing!
- What are you doing here?
- Bathing!
They tell me there's some people in this world takes a bath every week!
Women!
Mademoiselle, you want to swim?
Aw, baby!
Aw, no, girls! Don't go away!
- Please don't go!
Food! Whoo-hoo!
Halt!
You know you're forbidden to cross.
You fellows stay on this side or you'll get yourselves in a lot of trouble.
- What are they jabbering' about? - They want us to swing over tonight.
They're expecting us. - That's fine!
- That blonde's crazy about me.
- But there's four of us and only three of them.
- I was the one that stopped 'em!
That blonde piece of work is mine.
You three fight for what's left.
Fight's the word.
All's fair in love and war.
Huh? What do you mean?
What're you gonna do?
You'll find out.
- C'est moi, blondie!
She means the door.
Not only modest, but dashing!
A perfect fit.
It might've been made for me. An officer's coat.
We're calling distinguished company.
Have another little drink, comrade.
Is this your birthday or mine?
Why?
You've been buying me drink after drink for two hours.
What I'm tryin' to figure out is why.
Why?
Oh. I-It's just that the boys... told me to amuse you for a little while.
Oh, nice boys.
Yeah!
They-They said you'd understand.
I've been betrayed!
Yeah, you certainly have.
Take that for a minute!
I'll give you more!
It's too loud.
Suzanne. And I wouldn't even know you if I did.
And yet, I'll remember you always.
Oh, if you could only know how different this is from the women we soldiers meet.
You.
That's what I'm talking about.
It seems as though all war and terror and grossness... had fallen away from me... like a miracle.
Like something I never believed.
Frau Paul.
We're going, Paul.
Have a look.
Nice, new coffins.
Huh! For us.
I must say, that's a very cheerful preparation for this offensive.
That's very considerate of them. But I don't see any long enough for our comrade Tjaden.
Mind you, I'm not speaking to you, you traitors.
- But no coffin's gonna get me.
- I should say not, heartbreaker.
You'll be thankful if they slip a waterproof sheet... - around that Aunt Sally of a carcass of yours.
Oh-Oh, my side!
Catholic hospital, Albert.
They say you always get good food and good treatment.
- We're lucky.
- After that rainy dressing station... and 24 hours on the train, we deserve to have some luck.
I'm Hamacher.
Yeah, that's my name.
I got a crack in the head and they gave me a certificate stating, "Josef Hamacher is periodically... not responsible for his actions."
And ever since then, Hamacher has been having a grand time.
I hope you boys are not too badly wounded.
The others die off so quickly we don't have time to get acquainted.
You'll get to know us... very well.
Thank you.
You too.
I'm sorry, my dear.
It's time to go now.
Yes, sister.
Watch.
If they take his clothes away, you've seen the last of him.
- See? They're taking him to the dying room.
- Dying room?
When you're ready to kick the bucket, they get you out of the way so they can use the bed.
In the corner of the building there's a little room... right next to the morgue!
It's so convenient. It saves a lot of trouble.
But suppose he gets well?
I've seen a lot of 'em go in that dying room, but nobody ever comes back.
Sister.
- Is that you ringing, Paul?
- Yes.
- Is something going on?
- I think I have a hemorrhage.
The bandage is all wet.
I've been ringing forever and nobody comes.
- I think I'm bleeding.
- Sister, get me a sterile dressing and an ice pack.
- Why didn't someone call me?
- He's been ringing.
Nobody can walk, Sister.
- Sister, is it bad? - No. No, we'll be all right.
We've got it in time.
What's the matter?
What are you doing?
We must rearrange your bandages.
- Where are you taking me?
To the bandaging ward.
- No, no!
I'm not going!
I'm staying here! - Paul! Paul!
- Now, now!
- I'm not going to the dying room!
- We're going to the bandaging ward.
- Why are you taking my clothes?
You're lying to me!
But I'll come back.
I won't die!
I'll come back!
I won't die!
Sister Libertine, how is he?
Poor boy.
They had to amputate his leg.
Oh, he is... gone.
Hello.
Welcome home, Albert!
- How do you feel, kid?
- All right. But I've got such an awful pain.
My foot hur --
Hamacher. Did they cut my leg off?
Of course not!
How many did you have?
Two?
You still got 'em!
One, two!
Don't play the fool, Hamacher.
Tell me truthfully.
Of course not.
And you look fine.
Look.
See?
- I won't be a cripple. - Now, now.
- I won't live like that!
- Be calm. - I'll kill myself the first chance I get!
- Albert! - I won't live!
I won't live! - Yes, you will.
Albert, I've come back!
I told you I'd come back.
Look, everybody! I've come back!
- Paul! Paul!
- That's not where I'm going.
I live over there.
Paul, I'm so happy.
Hamacher, I've come back from the dead!
- It's most irregular.
- Albert, get well quickly... so we can go home soon.
- Everything will be all right now.
- Yes, Paul. Everything will be all right... now.
Oh! Paul! Paul!
Paul. - What's the matter, Paul?
- Nothing.
Paul. Give me your handkerchief.
- Mother?
- Here I am, Paul. Here I am.
Mother's ill.
- Are you wounded?
- No, Mother.
I got leave.
Here I am cryin' instead of being glad.
Anna, get down the jar of blackberries.
You still like them, don't you?
Yes, Mother.
I haven't had any for a long time.
We might almost have known you were coming.
- I'm making potato cakes.
- Don't let them burn.
Paul... sit down... beside me.
My Paul.
My baby.
I almost forgot, Mother.
I've got some little presents for you.
Look, Mother.
Bread, sausage and rice.
- Paul, you've been starving yourself. - Hmm-mm.
Hadn't I better go and tell Father Paul's home?
- Paul could watch the things on the stove.
- No, I'm getting up.
Oh, Paul, you're a soldier now, aren't you?
But somehow, I don't seem to know you.
I'll take these off, Mother.
I'll get your suit.
It's in the wardrobe, just where you left it.
Are you really here, Paul?
You won't--
You won't disappear, will you?
No. I'm here.
Your things are ready for you, Paul.
- I remember when you caught that one. - Yes.
And you took it away from me, didn't you?
Yes, I did.
We're behind the lines, but we know how to honor the soldier... who goes on in spite of blood and death.
Gentlemen, my son.
I'm glad to know you, young man, I am glad to know you.
How are things out there?
Terrible, eh? Terrible.
But we must carry on.
After all, you do at least get decent food out there.
Naturally, it's worse here. Naturally.
But the best for our soldiers all the time.
That's our motto.
The best for our soldiers.
But... - you must give the Frenchies a good licking!
And, if you boys want to come home, ehh, let me show you what you must do before you can come home.
Give us a hand there, men.
Now, then, there's the line.
Runs so, in a "V".
Here is St. Quentin.
You can see for yourself.
You're almost through now.
All right?
Shove ahead out there and don't stick to that everlasting French warfare!
Smash through the johnnies!
And then you will have peace.
When you get in it... the war isn't the way it looks back here.
Oh! You don't know anything about it.
Of course, you know about the details, but this relates to the whole!
You can't judge that.
Of course, you do your duty and you risk your life.
But for that, you receive the highest honor.
I said that every man in the war ought to have the lron Cross.
First, the enemy lines must be broken through in Flanders.
- On to Paris!
Push on to Paris!
- Right.
No, not in Flanders.
I'll tell you just where the break should come.
- Here.
- The enemy has too many reserves there.
- I insist upon Flanders!
- Why should they do that... when they're halfway through St. Quentin already?
Because Flanders is a flat country!
- No mountains, no obstructions!
- There's too many rivers there!
From the farms they have gone; from the schools, from the factories.
They have gone bravely, nobly, ever forward, realizing there is no other duty now but to save the fatherland. Paul!
How are you, Paul?
Glad to see you, Professor.
You've come at the right moment, Baumer!
Just at the right moment.
And as if to prove all I have said, here is one of the first to go.
A lad who sat before me on these very benches... who gave up all to serve in the first year of the war;
one of the iron youth who have made Germany invincible in the field.
Look at him-- sturdy and bronze and clear -eyed.
The kind of soldier every one of you should envy.
Oh, lad, you must speak to them.
You must tell them what it means to serve your fatherland.
- No, I can't tell them anything.
- You must, Paul.
Just a word.
Just tell them how much they're needed out there.
Tell them why you went and what it meant to you.
I can't say anything.
You can remember some deed of heroism, some touch of nobility. Tell about it.
I can't tell you anything you don't know.
We live in the trenches out there.
We fight.
We try not to be killed;
sometimes we are.
That's all.
No.
No, Paul.
I've been there!
I know what it's like.
That's not what one dwells on, Paul.
I heard you in here reciting that same old stuff, making more iron men, more young heroes.
You still think it's beautiful and sweet to die for your country, don't you?
We used to think you knew.
The first bombardment taught us better.
It's dirty and painful to die for your country.
When it comes to dying for your country, it's better not to die at all!
There are millions out there dying for their countries, and what good is it?
You asked me to tell them how much they're needed out there.
He tells you, "Go out and die."
Oh, but if you'll pardon me, it's easier to say "Go out and die" than it is to do it.
- Coward!
- And it's easier to say it than to watch it happen.
No!
Boys, boys!
- I'm sorry, Baumer, but I must say--
- It's no use talking like this.
You won't know what I mean.
Only, it's been a long while since we enlisted out of this classroom.
So long I thought maybe the whole world had learned by this time.
Only now they're sending babies, and they won't last a week!
I shouldn't have come on leave.
Up at the front you're alive or you're dead, and that's all!
You can't fool anybody about that very long.
Up there we know we're lost and done for whether we're dead or alive.
Three years we've had of it-- four years.
Every day a year and every night a century.
Our bodies are earth and our thoughts are clay, and we sleep and eat with death.
We're done for because you can't live that way and keep anything inside you!
I shouldn't have come on leave.
I'll go back tomorrow.
I've got four days more, but I can't stand it here!
I'll go back tomorrow!
Sorry.
Mother, you'll catch cold here.
You must go to sleep.
There'll be plenty of time to sleep... when you're gone.
Must you go tomorrow, Paul?
Must you? Yes, Mother.
Orders were changed.
Are you very much afraid, Paul?
No, Mother.
There's something I want to say to you, Paul.
It's-- Just be on your guard against the women out there.
They're no good.
Where we are, there aren't any women, Mother.
Be very careful at the front, Paul.
Yes, Mother, I will.
I'll pray for you every day.
And if you could, get a job that's not quite so dangerous.
Yes, Mother.
I'll try and get in the cookhouse.
- That can easily be done.
- You do it then, and if the others say anything--
That won't worry me, Mother.
Now, you must go to bed and you must get well quickly before I come back.
I put two sets of underwear -- new ones-- in your pack.
They'll keep you nice and warm.
They're all wool.
That's sweet of you.
Good night...
Good night, Mother.
Oh, Mother, Mother.
You still think I'm a child.
Why can't I put my head in your lap and cry?
- Is this the 2nd Company?
- Is this all of it?
- Yes, sir.
We had 150 men, but this is all that came back yesterday.
But now they're going to give us enough to make 150 again.
How old are you?
Sixteen.
No use.
I couldn't find anything.
- We'll have to eat the sawdust.
Not me!
I'll go hungry first. It makes me sick.
Now it's gonna be a real war again.
Paul!
How's old Paul?
Here I am.
You know, the 2nd Company's getting hard to find.
Nobody seemed to know where you were.
I'm glad you found it.
I guess I don't get much of this.
There used to be some food in the sawdust.
Now it's all sawdust.
No joke, either.
Eats ya up inside.
This doesn't look much like the old 2nd Company.
The replacements are all like that.
Not even old enough to carry a pack.
All they know how to do is die.
I guess... some of the old-timers are here yet.
Paul, they're tryin' to invent somethin' to kill me right now.
Where's Westhus?
Messenger dog was wounded.
He went out to get it. - Is it true about the armistice?
- Doesn't look that way back there.
- You mean they want us to go on fighting?
- That's what they say.
They're crazy!
Germany'll be empty pretty soon.
Where is-- Where is Detering?
He got homesick.
You remember about the cherry blossoms?
I guess he never got over that.
He started out one night to go home and help his wife with the farm.
They got him behind the lines, and we never heard of him since.
He was just homesick, but probably they couldn't see it that way.
Where's Kat?
Is he--
Not Kat!
If he were out, the war would be over.
You remember what he always says:
They're savin' him for the last.
- Where is he?
- He's out lookin' for food, something to make soup with.
-Which way?
-Down the road about two miles that way.
I'll see you later.
Kat!
Paul!
Hello, Paul.
- How's the side? - Oh, it's all right now.
It's fine.
- Have any luck?
- No, the general's staff's been over this country with a rake.
Let's sit down there.
Tell me, Paul... how was it at home?
Have a good leave?
- In spots.
- What's the matter?
Ohh... I'm no good for back there anymore, Kat.
None of us are.
We've been in this too long.
The young men thought I was a coward because I told them that... we learn that death is stronger than duty to one's country.
The old men said, "Go on.
Push on to Paris."
My father even wanted me to wear my uniform around him.
It's not home back there anymore.
All I could think of was, "I'd like to get back and see Kat again."
You're all I've got left, Kat.
I'm not much to have left.
I missed you, Paul.
At least we know what it's all about out here.
There're no lies here. Push on to Paris?
You ought to see what they've got on the other side.
They eat white bread over there.
They've got dozens of airplanes to our one, and tanks that'll go over anything.
What've we got left?
Guns so worn they drop shells on our own men.
No food, no ammunition, no officers.
Push on to Paris!
So that's the way they talk back there.
I guess we'd better be going.
How I lied to my poor mother.
I told her it wasn't so bad out here because there was always a lot of us together.
Now that I'm with you, I'm beginning to believe that I told her the truth.
Down!
That's another one that missed us.
Come on.
Let's go. Wait a minute.
Looks like the old bread wagon's broke down.
- I guess I don't walk the rest of the way.
- Did that get ya, Kat?
Aah, I think it broke my shin.
That's not so bad.
Hold it together.
- Just my luck, huh?
- Good luck.
That means the war is over.
Oh, no, sir!
This war don't end till they really get me.
Now this one-- - Aah. - Easy, now.
- Hey!
Easy! Come on.
I'll take you in.
Give me your hand.
Easy.
Well, kid... now we're gonna be separated.
Maybe we can do something together later on when the war is over.
- Yes, kid.
- You give me your address, I'll give you mine.
You can't get both of us in one day.
Ah, we'll surely see each other again, Kat.
Remember that day when you brought the whole pig into the factory?
And that day in the woods when you taught us how to dodge shells?
And my first bombardment.
How I cried.
I was a young recruit then.
Here we are.
All right now, Kat.
You could've spared yourself the trouble.
He's dead.
Oh, no. He's just fainted.
He was hit in the shin.
He's dead.
Would you like to take his pay book?
- You're not related, are you?
- No, we're not related.
Your deal.
Get his name and number?
Yeah, Corporal Stanislaus Katczinsky, 306.
Extra! Read all about it!
Again a fresh election!
Read all about it!
Extra!
Apples.
Apples.
Where do you think you're going?
What do you mean...?
Shut up, you pasty-faced palookas.
Apples, apples.
Apples.
Hey, Annie!
Come round to the house sometime.
I got a lot of silverware hanging around loose.
Apples.
Hello, Schultzie, how's business?
Not so good over at the Apollo.
Go over to the Casino.
They got a hit over there.
Is that so?
I'll go right over.
Thanks.
Yeah.
If you changed your tune, perhaps you'd have better luck.
The Dude wants to see you, Annie.
He's over at Missouri Martin's.
Yeah, I know.
How's pickings, Smiley?
Terrible. Everybody's broke.
Must be tough on them.
Stop yappin'.
Didn't you hear the President over the radio?
Get on over to the Casino.
They've got a hit over there.
- They have?
- Sure. Spread it around.
Don't forget Missouri Martin's.
Dude said it was important.
Alright, I won't.
Apples.
Apples.
Okay, girls.
What's going on?
- What's the mystery?
- Babe, Dude's got a big bet on.
- Yeah, what kind of bet?
- You're liable to scare the fly.
What fly?
Dude bet the Greek the fly would land on his piece of sugar first.
- What do you say, Dude?
500 more?
- You're on.
What do you think you're doing, Shakespeare?
I'm decoying him, Dude, over to your lump.
Tough luck, Dude.
That's 1500 you owe me.
I bet the Greek's got them flies trained.
Now that the animal act's over, let's get going.
- Yeah, we better get going.
- Let's blow.
Hey, Dude, I give you a chance to get even.
- Nothing doing.
- Alright.
This is a lot of hokum, playing around with flies when a real sucker's waiting for us, with real dough.
What's the matter, handsome?
I should have know better than to bet without my apple.
I'm going to find Apple Annie.
You're searching for her now?
Listen, Happy. This is one of the biggest stud games l've sat in.
I'm not taking any chances.
Look what just happened to me.
I even lost to the Greek.
Did I tell you about the fella, superstitious about a hunchback?
He went looking for him one day and got run over by a truck.
A fella told me it was hard luck to be superstitious.
- Go out and find Apple Annie.
- Okay, Dude.
I'm on my way.
I'm a first class monkey if I can see how you can win pots by buying apples from old dames.
Can't find your apple, Dude?
Here's something for good luck.
Cut it out. Cut it out.
He wants apples, not lemons.
Happy, in case you break anything, make sure it's your neck.
- Hello, Annie.
- Hello, Dude.
- Did I keep you waiting?
- No.
You've got a great racket, Annie.
Couple more suckers like the Dude and you can retire in a year.
Pull up your chin, Happy, you're liable to step on it.
- Never mind the change.
- God bless you.
- So how'd you do last week?
- Okay.
Where were you Saturday?
I couldn't win a race.
Saturday?
I wasn't feeling so good Saturday.
- Drinking again.
- Who? Me?
I ain't touched a drop in weeks.
Cut it out.
Doc Michel says your kidneys are all shot.
He's an old fool, doesn't know what he's talking about.
If you two are going to discuss Annie's kidneys...
Your car's ready, Mr. Dude.
Mr. Dude, I can't find her no place.
There you are!
The Dude wants to see you.
Nice work, Shakespeare.
So long, Annie.
I bet the cards treat you right tonight, Dude.
They will, I'll tell 'em the Dude bought an apple from Annie.
Did you get it?
Don't I always get it?
- The classiest stationary we have.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Oscar.
- That bunch costs you 50 cents.
50 cents?
You never charge me more than two bits.
It's conditions.
People don't leave things in their rooms anymore.
It's got so bad I have to buy my own toothpaste.
- That's awful, Oscar.
- Even my wife's complaining.
Remember when she was the best-smelling woman on the block?
I brought her back so much perfume she used to stink with it.
- Cheer up. Things will get better.
- I guess so.
When are you expecting your next letter?
There's a mail boat in from Spain in the morning.
Okay, I'll watch out for it.
There's a good soul!
I'll pay you beginning of the week.
And don't you forget it.
If I'm caught stealing letters, I'll get fired.
- No, you mustn't get fired.
- They will if they catch me.
Who are you getting these letters from anyhow?
None of your business.
- A new lover, eh?
- That's it.
A new lover.
You old devil, you.
Get out of the way.
That's for getting in the way.
Hey, scat!
The very idea.
Couldn't you find any other place to sleep on but my picture?
"My dear... adorable... daughter. The social season... is over.
And so,
the reception... I came to... Lord... Lord Woodcliff's."
Here's to Lord Woodcliff.
"They say to wish you success."
I just love Annie's music.
"It breaks my heart that I've not been able to see you these years, but Doctor Michel, the old crab,
still says it would be fatal for me to make an ocean voyage.
Your stepfather thought he might make the trip this year."
You didn't know you had a stepfather, did you?"
Neither did I.
"The young man you write about sounds perfectly darling.
I hope he loves you as much as you love him.
As much as I love you, my darling.
Oscar, where have you been?
You shouldn't keep me waiting when I'm expecting a letter.
Why, Oscar.
Where's your uniform?
Oscar, what's happened?
You haven't lost your job?
You shouldn't fool me like this.
They can't fire you!
They can't, eh?
Well, they did.
They caught me putting your letter in my pocket.
Where's my letter?
What am I going to tell the wife?
That's what I want to know.
- Where's my letter?
- How do I know?
They took it.
Annie, where you going?
They won't let you in that way.
Hey!
Hey!
You must be in the wrong place, madam.
- Peasants aren't allowed in here.
- There's a strict rule about...
Let me go, let me go!
I beg your pardon.
Oh, my goodness.
There's some mail here for me, a letter.
Mail?
Are you stopping here, Madam?
No, but there's a letter.
It came this morning for me.
It's from Barcelona, Spain.
It's very important.
Well, what is your name, please?
Mrs. E. Worthington Manville.
- Mrs. E. Worthington Manville?
- Yes.
Mrs. E. Worthington Manville.
I'm the manager.
Anything I can do for you?
Yes, if you please.
There's a letter here for me and I'd like to get it.
Letter?
Addressed to the hotel?
Yes... I told that other man all about it.
By the time they're finished, she'll look as good as me.
The idea is to make her look like a lady.
"Laughing Boy" is in again.
All right, flesh pounders, this is going to be a sweet job.
- Alright, Annie, let's go.
- We will make you beautiful.
- Come on. - 'Atta gal.'
The hair the biggest problem.
It's all right, Annie.
You won't get to first base.
You'll have lead her on a string.
Take her in that bedroom.
Wait a minute, he can't go in there.
It's alright, Dude, it's alright.
Pierre.
Alright, girls, that's all.
Folks, meet Mrs. E. Worthington Manville.
I'll never forget you for this.
God bless you.
Okay, okay.
Yeah, you look fine.
You'd fool anybody.
Nice work, Missouri.
Come on, Happy. Let's get going.
Wait a minute, you guys.
Where do you think you're going?
We're returning to the business of making a living,
- if it's just the same to you.
- You think you're through?
- What about the husband?
- Husband?
Worthington Manville, Who's gonna dig him up?
I forgot all about the husband.
Missouri, go back in and tell her to take care of that herself.
That's a brilliant idea.
Who's she gonna get, one of her panhandler friends.?
He got her the apartment and a flock of clothes.
What more do you want?
- You can take care of it.
- Oh, I can, can I?
Very sweet of you.
Whose idea was this, anyway?
I'm a kibbutzer in this, now you want to give it me?
You got another guess coming!
I like Annie as much as anybody, but if you guys are running out, I'm going too.
I'm a sucker if I'm gonna be left holding the bag.
You want the Dude to give up his business?
I got a night club needs looking after.
That comical hole in the wall?
Don't make me laugh.
If I could make you laugh, I'd go out and get drunk!
You couldn't make a hyena laugh.
Wait a minute, what do you mean, talking to her like that?
Stop arguing and let's do something.
If we gotta dig up a husband, let's get it over with.
Now you gotta dig up a husband for her.
Where you gonna get a husband, just like that?
What about you, Happy?
Me?
That's a swell idea.
I think you'd be just precious.
Wonderful idea.
Just one thing stands in the way.
I got a wife that's very fussy.
She don't like for me to go around marrying people.
I know how unreasonable that must sound to you, but she's funny that way.
No.
I got just the one!
Judge Henry G. Blake.
Who's he?
For a proposition like this, we need a guy that talks classy.
Well, judge Blake is the classiest talker in town.
- Shakespeare.
- Yes, Boss.
Judge Blake, the guy that told you you could shoot pool is taking you for a sleigh ride.
Granted, my boy, granted.
In Providence, where l come from, a cripple like you would be taken for all he's got.
That's one of the reasons I never go to Providence.
If you did, you'd come back without your pants.
How much longer must I toy with this be-knighted son of Providence?
Take it easy, judge.
This guy's a cinch.
Any minute now he'll want to jack up the ante.
I'm becoming annoyed at this silly twaddle.
If the sap knew who the judge was, he'd go home.
If the stakes were higher, you might do better.
Success at last.
Do better?
I doubt it, my friend.
Thought you might want to double the bet.
How about 10 cents a ball?
10 cents?
A veritable fortune.
Afraid, huh?
Afraid?
Nobody ever said that to me and got away with it!
Did you know that during the reign of King Charles 2nd, we were known as "The Fearless Blakes"?
I'll show you how afraid I am!
I'll make it 50 cents a ball!
Okay, come on!
- Boy, rack 'em up! - Yes, sir.
Come on.
Set 'em up.
Let's get goin'.
Judge.
My old friend, the Bard of Avon.
- Dude wants to see you right away.
- Can't be done, my friend.
I am engaged in a very profitable enterprise.
I don't know nothing about that.
In fact, my next month's room rent depends on it.
Come on, judge. It's your shot.
Wait, the Dude said not to take no for an answer.
- You know what that means.
- Yes, I've had occasion.
What's the matter, judge?
Getting cold feet?
There he is, the lucky stiff.
I'll probably lose him for life.
- Excuse me.
- Step on it, judge.
Guys, you're holding up the game.
I thought you were known as "The Fearless Blakes"?
You were born under a lucky star, my friend.
A 6 ball shot, friends, one in each pocket, shooting left-handed.
Amazing.
Quiet, boys!
Great shot!
- Collect from Providence. - Right.
That was some shot.
And with the left hand.
Thank you, me lad.
Proceed, Shakespeare.
It's only for a week, judge.
All you do is be her rich, aristocratic husband.
The rich and aristocratic suits me admirably.
- Ever try being a husband?
- I'm notorious for it.
- How'd you make out.
- Pitifully, pitifully.
They were charming women, too. All four of them.
I'm sorry you brought that up.
I can't understand why I should prove such a miserable failure.
You probably talked them to death.
- What do you say?
- I'm interested.
- Whose husband?
- Never mind that.
Now here's the layout.
You're going to be the ever-lovin' husband of Apple Annie.
Preposterous!
Most preposterous!
Of all people, Apple Annie.
Listen, Dude, this is asking much too much.
A mere apple vendor, practically a mendicant.
- Good afternoon.
- Here she is now.
- Here who is?
- Apple Annie.
The judge was saying how glad he was to be your husband.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
I am deeply flattered.
The pleasure, I assure you, my dear and charming lady, is all mine.
19 and a half.
See, Happy?
An apartment, clothes, judge Blake and the thing was cinched.
Just between you and me, I got quite a bang out of it.
Maybe now that's over, we can revive the Babcock deal.
'Revive it'?
You mean, you let it get away?
I let it get away?
You laid down on the job, huh?
I should've known that.
Say, listen, Babcock wore out the seats of two pairs of pants sitting on his "El Fideldo".
All right, all right.
Call him up.
Tell him I'm ready.
I'll come right over.
I let it get away!
Hello, Dude.
- I'm glad I found you in.
- What do you want?
I want to see you before the boat got in.
Annie's daughter arrives today.
Yeah, I know.
Alright, men, scram.
I'll see you tomorrow.
I shouldn't hurry so.
It plays havoc with my dignity.
What's on your mind, judge?
Come on, I got business...
Dude, you played an abominable trick on that poor old woman.
I what?
My dear Dude, do you know the number of reporters
- that meet the incoming boats?
- Well?
They'll want to know all about the Count, why he came to America, who his friends are.
That means me and Apple Annie.
Sure, a guy named Winchell would give his right eye for a story like this.
I told you you couldn't get away with it!
Why didn't you think of that?
Why didn't I think of it?
Yeah.
Why tell me now?
What are we gonna do?
What are you gonna do?
You started it.
It's your party.
Well, I'm leaving it to you.
You better see those reporters stay away.
- What time's that boat come in?
- I hope it sinks.
In about an hour.
I better go with you to see nothing goes wrong.
- Come on, judge.
- Coming!
Goodbye, Sad Eyes.
Some 'phonus balonus' round here.
Yeah, Dave the Dude isn't here for his health.
His whole mob ain't.
Tell your mugs to hold the circle and don't let anyone near us.
Don't worry, the only way they get in is with a tank.
- Let's see what happens.
- Not a bad idea.
- How do I look?
- Great. Okay.
- How does Annie look?
- You wouldn't know her, Schultzie.
I remember when Annie looked like that all the time.
Notterhead took me over and she smelled good.
I can hardly believe it.
In a little while I'll be holding my baby in my arms.
Yes, there she is.
There she is!
Louise!
Louise!
Louise!
Louise!
Look!
Louise, it's your mother.
There's Mother!
She recognizes me.
She recognizes me.
It's mother!
It's mother dear!
Mother!
Louise.
Louise.
I can't wait.
She'll be down.
Louise!
Louise!
Louise!
My baby.
Let me look at you.
You're beautiful.
I'm so happy.
I'd know you anywhere.
- What are they doing?
- They're kissing.
- Is Annie happy?
- Yeah, she's crying.
My sweet!
You're just as I pictured you, Mother.
- My baby.
- Just as I pictured you.
Enough tears around here to float a battleship.
This is your stepfather, dear.
Mother's written me so much about you.
May I present Count Alfonso Romero and his son, Carlos.
How do you do?
It is indeed a pleasure, my dear Count.
We've been looking forward to this visit for some time.
Thank you.
How stupid of me.
This is... your Uncle David.
My uncle?
I didn't know I had an uncle.
You must be Father's brother.
I'm so pleased.
Why, Mother, you didn't write a word about him.
That's because Brother David is the black sheep of the family.
I want you to meet Count Romero and his son Carlos.
- This is my uncle, David Manville.
- How do you do?
- Where do you think you're going?
- Are you talking to me?
I ain't talking to your Aunt Tilly.
I'm a news reporter.
I want to chat with the Count.
You're wrong.
He ain't no Count.
No?
Yeah, somebody threw you a bum steer.
Shows you what a rumor will do.
What you want to do is go over to Pier 48.
There's a boat coming in from the Argentines.
Maybe there's a king and queen on it, you can't tell.
Take this man to Pier 48.
It's in the Bronx.
- But 48 is down by the Battery.
- In the Bronx!
Wonder what their racket is?
Looks like a couple of foreigners being taken over.
Let's talk to the Dude.
Happy, a couple of cops are going to see the Dude.
Holy smoke!
We gotta stop 'em.
Go start a fight.
Sock the Weasel.
- The Weasel?
He's my brother!
- I said sock him.
Hey, Weasel.
I hate to do this.
Fight!
Fight!
Fight! Fight!
- Your car is waiting, sir.
- Thank you, my good man.
Am-scray! A couple of oos-bay!
We'd better be going.
The cars are waiting.
You'll enjoy the ride, Count.
- Know where the family went?
- They went for a ride, sir.
- Where did they go yesterday?
- Went riding, I think, sir.
- The day before?
- The same thing, sir.
That's fine.
Here... that's for your expenses.
- And that's for you.
- Thank you, sir.
- Remember your general orders?
- Yes, sir.
"If I'm asked any questions, I know nothing.
As a matter of fact, I'm completely dumb."
Fine. You think you can do it?
That should be a cinch.
I beg your pardon, sir?
I said, that should be a lead pipe cinch.
If I had a choice of weapons with you, sir, I'd choose grammar.
- Remember, don't flop on this.
- No, sir.
If you do, your family better send for the body.
- I have no family, sir.
- You won't have no body neither.
Nobody...
Come on.
I don't wanna be here when the family gets back.
Uncle David!
Hello.
There you are.
I'm so glad to see you.
Hello, Mr. Manville.
Where have you been?
We missed you terribly.
Well, that's something.
Don't be so strange.
Everybody's crazy about you.
Carlos and I are going to name our children after you.
If we're talking about children, be a good idea to get married.
- When does it take place?
- I don't know.
Everyone's making a fuss about it.
Mother wants the wedding here, for just the family.
The Count wants it in Spain with the whole world attending.
Sorry, Ma...
We don't care where it happens, as long as it happens.
That's the way to talk.
- Hello, Brother David.
- Edward.
- Hello, Mr. McGuire.
- Judge.
You've all met David's secretary.
Yeah, my... secretary, everybody.
I'm so glad you came, Mr. McGuire.
You might want to invite him to our reception.
Sure, good idea.
Come on, Happy.
Reception?
What do you mean 'reception'?
We're having a reception for the folks day after tomorrow, the night their boat returns to Spain.
Isn't that just dandy.
You're surprised, aren't you, Brother David?
Yeah.
Thought you would be, knowing me.
I've never known a man to detest receptions so violently as the judge.
Who's coming, Brother Edward?
Just a few of our friends.
A small affair, 100, 150 perhaps.
Hardly a handful.
The Count is tired of seeing buildings, aren't you?
He wants to meet our friends.
The Count will love our friends.
Of course, I'll look to you, Brother David, to help me.
Of course, of course.
I'd like to have a talk with you before you do anything about it.
There's one or two things I want to straighten you out on.
By all means, Brother David.
- Yes, john?
- A newspaperman to see you, sir.
What does he want, john?
Perhaps he's heard about the Count and wants to write about him.
Perhaps you better see him on your way out, Brother David.
You're so clever at handling newspapermen.
I'll handle him.
What can we do for you?
Society reporter, The Star.
I want to get a story on Mrs. E. Worthington Manville.
I can't find mention of her in the social register.
Imagine that?
He couldn't find her in the social register.
- I can't understand it.
- What did you want to know?
Just a general biography.
Say, wait a minute.
Aren't you Dave the Dude?
Dave the Dude?
What's he talking about, Albert?
The house is full of guests.
Let's go somewhere undisturbed.
Alright, but I could swear that you're Dave the Dude.
There's a room here that's not often used.
Sure we won't be disturbed, Arthur?
No, not a chance, uncle.
This is for family heirlooms. Some of them go way back.
Again?
You'll always love me, won't you, Carlos?
You know I will.
Has your father said anything yet?
No.
What will we do if he doesn't give his consent?
If he doesn't like Mother and Dad?
- What will we do, Carlos?
- Don't be worried, darling.
He's really fond of them.
He likes to be formal about things.
I'd just die if anything happens.
I'll just die, Carlos.
Mother?
I was in my room, and I was so lonesome.
You don't mind if I pay you a little visit?
- Of course not.
- It's my fault.
I've taken up Louise's time.
I've been terribly selfish.
No, you haven't.
You've been sweet.
I'll go in and talk to Dad, if you'll excuse me.
Good night, Mother.
You don't mind my calling you Mother, do you?
- I just love it.
- Thank you.
- Night, Louise.
- Good night, Carlos.
He's a lovely boy.
Mother, I'm so happy.
My baby.
Mother?
Yes, my sweet.
You don't think anything can happen?
Happen?
I guess I've just been foolish, because I've been wishing so hard.
Mother, did you ever wish for anything so hard that...?
Nothing's going to happen.
Nothing's going to happen.
Reception, huh?
You stayed up too late.
You're in a swell apartment and you began to believe it.
For my dough, you're still a penny-ante pool shark!
- Now after all, my dear Dude...
- Oh, shut up.
- Don't get cross, Brother David.
- Don't 'Brother David' me!
Listen you...
Hello?
Yeah. What do you want?
I'm sorry to trouble you, Mr. Dude, but the Count asked me to get the Spanish Consulate on the phone.
Why is he calling him?
What do you know about that?
He's calling the Spanish Consulate.
Maybe he's checking up on us.
- How's your Spanish, Happy?
- Good as my French, they smell.
And what about you?
I'll tell you, when I was in Havana.
Never mind that!
Hello?
- The Spanish Consulate, sir.
- Thank you very much.
Close the door, please.
Consular not home.
Just me, Japanese boy.
No, sir.
Consular not home.
He gone away long time.
Maybe come back next week.
No, me Japanese boy.
Consular not home.
Thank you.
Very good.
Very, very good.
Japanese boy.
Very difficult to understand.
I think he said "Consular out of town".
I'm glad.
I think it was very unsportsmanlike.
Carlos!
I'm sorry, Father, but that's how I feel.
- It'd be terrible if...
- lt can't be helped, son.
After all, we know nothing about these people.
I may be wrong, but their behavior seems... strange.
I cannot quite put my finger on it.
What difference does that make?
- I love Louise.
- You must let me handle this.
If they're all right, nothing to worry about. You can be married soon as we return home.
Meantime, no reason we can't wait till the reception is over before we decide.
I want to meet their friends.
Well, what about it?
What about the reception?
The reception, my dear Dude, if I may be allowed one small word, is inevitable.
I don't know what stops me from putting a slug in you.
Personally, I wouldn't mind that at all.
I'm rather bored with the whole rotten business of living anyway.
He was a wise old sage who said: "Any man over 40 should be exterminated."
- Who said that?
- I don't know. Someone should've.
What good is a man over 40?
Take yourself, for instance.
- Yeah, I'm only 34.
- Only 34.
- I'd have sworn you were 50.
- What?
Look at yourself.
Positively jowly.
No, you're kidding me!
Incidentally, I have a very good exercise for that.
It's something like this, a head movement.
You do it 24 times, every morning.
- Like this, huh?
- No, more up and down movement.
- Like this, huh?
- Yes, that's much better.
Pardon me for horning in on your calisthenics,
but you were gonna put the slug on him a couple of minutes ago.
Yeah, that's right.
How about it?
What do you want me to do, say my prayers?
- No, about the reception.
- It was gonna be so simple.
Rodney Kent's apartment, a few clothes and it's a wipe.
What a shock you'll get when you wake up on bare steel.
- What for?
- A simple matter of abduction.
It's 'agin the law', I've been told.
You mean, that society reporter?
No, I mean those three society reporters.
Three of 'em?
Sure.
We had to put 'em in the bag. Don't ya read the papers?
Take a peek at the headlines.
See if your japanese dialect will get you out of this one.
Forget it.
They're still in Rodney Kent's storeroom?
Yeah.
- Bugs Malone still with them?
- Yeah.
Well, forget it.
I'll square that later.
What I'm most interested in is that reception.
Look, judge. You go to Annie and tell her it's all off.
- What?
- Sure... I guess I'm a sentimental old fool but don't ask me to deliberately break that poor old woman's heart.
Stop it. You're breaking mine.
Where are you gonna get the people?
You gotta have a lot of high-class people, don't ya?
That, my dear Dude, is very simple.
It may surprise you to know that in my own senile way, I've found the solution.
Look, in reality I am judge Henry G. Blake, exponent of pool, penny-ante pool, if you wish.
Yeah, go on.
But to Count Romero, I am E. Worthington Manville,
- a celebrated statesman.
- Yeah.
Now, is there any reason why Louie the Lug couldn't be the Ambassador to Turkey?
What?
Or wouldn't the Weasel make an excellent...
- Secretary of War?
The Weasel?
If Missouri Martin was introduced to me as a New York society leader,
- l wouldn't doubt it.
- Well, I would.
And those girls in her club?
There you have two dozen of the finest debutantes in town.
You're off your nut!
Open their kissers and the roof would fall on 'em.
That's the trick.
They won't open their kissers, except for a few introductory speeches which I'll dash off for them.
Judge, I think you've got it.
Sure, why not?
I'll tell them the first one who opens his yap will get slugged.
Now where's my address book?
Well, I give up.
When Louie the Lug becomes Ambassador to Turkey, I don't wanna be around anymore.
I'm going over to the insane asylum and hobnob with a few sensible people.
Judge, give me a hand.
You get on this phone. See if there's anyone at Boyle's. You oughta know that number.
A swell idea, judge.
We'll marry Apple Annie's daughter off or bust a gut!
Hello, my good man.
Would you connect me with Harry the Horse?
Hello, Butch.
- Yeah?
- Cap. Moore, Inspector.
- Send him right in!
- Yes, sir.
Well?
Nothing doing, Inspector.
That's what you told me yesterday and the day before that.
We gotta find those three reporters and quick!
Look what the newspapers are doing to us!
I've done everything, covered every angle.
Nothing but excuses, that's all I've been getting.
You better get going...
- Yeah?
- The Commissioner on the phone.
- Who?
- The Commissioner.
There he is again.
Fourth time today.
Hello, Commissioner.
No. I've got Cap. Moore in my office now.
Not a thing?
That's all I've been getting for the last few days.
What have you got there, a bunch of schoolboys?
Listen, McCreary, I'm not gonna be made the goat of the department.
Find those reporters or I'll...
Hello?
- Mayor's on the phone, sir.
- The Mayor?
- Yes, sir.
- Didn't you tell him I was out?
- No, I didn 't.
- Alright, put him on.
Yes, sir.
Hold on a minute.
Mayor's on the phone again.
Hello?
Yes, hello, Chief.
No, I was just talking to Inspector McCreary.
Not a thing yet.
What are you going to do about it?
Sit and wait for those reporters to walk into your office?
Yes, yes. I've heard that before.
I'm only interested in one thing.
I want some action and quick!
Every editor in town is in my office this minute.
You'll get front page editorial every day till something's done.
Our reporters can't get news without a bodyguard.
I want this clear, Commissioner: I refuse to stand the brunt for the incompetence of the Police Department!
If City administration can't do anything, perhaps the State can.
When the Governor gets in town this afternoon, we'll see him.
Find those reporters or I'll be forced to ask for your resignation.
Now that's final.
Hello, McCreary.
Now get this straight, dig up those reporters or I'll get me another boy.
And that's that!
Captain, I'm giving you 24 hours to find those reporters.
If you can't, you'd better start looking for another job.
And that's the works!
Yes, sir.
What is it, Murphy?
A young fella with an angle on the reporter business.
- Come on, speak up.
- A funny thing happened. I was down at the boats and went to talk to a count, when a couple of yeggs grabbed me and put me in a car.
- What happened?
- They took me to the Bronx?
- How'd you get away?
- They stopped and I jumped out.
- Who were the men?
- I don't know.
Maybe I can tell you something about that, Inspector.
When did this happen?
- Last Tuesday.
- That checks all right.
Ken and I were down working the pier last week.
Dave the Dude was meeting some people.
Had his whole mob with him.
We thought it was funny.
Dave the Dude, eh?
This is beginning to look like a police department.
Sit down, I want to talk to you.
Get this straight. I ain't having this rehearsal 'cause I like it!
The reception is tomorrow night.
You don't rehearse now, you'll bollocks up the thing.
You've got your titles, speeches, everything laid out.
First learn your speeches.
The judge went to a lot of trouble to rig up some swell ones and I don't want ya to blow 'em.
Alright, come on.
Let's get going.
No, no.
You're too stiff, you're too stiff.
Relax, can't you? Relax.
Butch, your legs are buckling.
Bend from the waist.
Harry the Horse... you don't want to look like you're gonna kick her!
No, and smile.
Go on, keep smiling.
Sure, you're supposed to be having a good time.
Louie the Lug. What do you think you're doing?
You're the Ambassador to Turkey, not a wrestler.
Holy mackerel, this is awful.
Cheesecake.
What's the matter?
Is it too much for you?
- No, I can do it. Only...
- Only what?
I'm as good as Louie the Lug is any day.
If he's Ambassador, I oughta be King.
Listen, Secretary of the lnterior is bigger than Ambassador.
- Yeah?
- Sure.
You can't fool me.
A secretary is a secretary.
Then you're President of the Board.
How do you like that?
President?
Now that's something like it!
Judge, we got a new President of the Board.
Check!
Come here.
You too, Micks.
You two do your stuff.
Quiet!
The rest of you guys, quiet!
Micks here's the Count, see?
Now I want to hear your speech.
- Did I knocked onto this guy?
- Well, you're introduced to him.
I get ya, I get ya.
Count... I am... lt's a rare... its a rare privy... privy...
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
It's a rare 'privilege', you dope.
I can't make the grade with words like this.
Look...
- if the judge... - Get away.
You're driving me nuts!
Well, what's the matter?
Are you all quitting?
Come on. Let's get going. Rehearse.
Rehearse!
Charmed to meet you Count.
You stink.
Call it,
- Heads.
- Tails!
That makes me the King of Siam.
Couple more wins and you'll be in charge of the whole world.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Quiet, guest.
Quiet.
Quiet everybody!
Look like we'll have to take it one thing at a time.
Forget the speeches right now. Just take up the bowing.
Judge, come and show 'em how to bow.
Now watch this close.
See, his knees don't buckle.
Look where the hand is. Isn't that graceful?
Look at that smile.
See, there ain't anything tough about that.
Come on, everybody do it.
Now, no speeches.
Just bow.
Everybody just bow now.
I don't believe it.
Where do you think you're going?
Come here.
About time you showed up.
I beg your...
You got me doing it now.
Don't worry, you could stand plenty of practice.
Cut the clowning.
These guys have got me crazy.
You're not doin' them any good.
I'm going through with it, see?
Hey, stop it.
Stop it.
Wait a minute everybody now.
Trouble with a lot of you guys is you don't take this serious.
Well, let me tell you something.
It's serious... and the guy that don't think it is can take it on the lam now.
Listen fellas, I don't want to get tough with ya, but we gotta go through with it.
It ain't for me.
Nobody's gonna get anything outta it.
Happy here thinks I'm nuts.
Well, maybe I am, I don't know.
But I started it and I gotta go through with it.
It's for Apple Annie, see?
She's in a tough spot and it's up to us to give her a break.
If anything goes wrong tomorrow night, there's no telling what she'll do.
So let's practice and practice hard.
Now we'll take up the Apple Annie speech.
All you girls are Apple Annie, see?
Fellas, pick yourself a dame.
You're being introduced to her. Alright, let's go.
Alright, everybody.
Let's get organized.
The Apple Annie speech.
Put a little ginger into it.
- Quiet, everybody.
- Quiet, everybody.
- Quiet!
- Quiet!
The Indians are upon us.
- Hello, Dude.
- Hi.
- What's going on around here?
- Nothing you'd be interested in.
Funny your whole mob up here at one time.
Anything wrong with a guy having his friends up?
No, nothing wrong in that.
These mugs are classy, ain't they?
Okay, everybody. Go on home.
Rehearsal is over.
Putting on a show, Dude?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, a benefit performance.
Good night, Dude.
So long.
Dude and Fish is what gets me.
The whole mob was up there.
You didn't ask about the three reporters, did ya?
That's good.
- Yes, sir?
- Send in O'Brien and Gibbons.
Listen, you two fellas watch the Dude. Don't let him know he's tailed.
Anything looks phony, let me know right away.
I want a tail on every one of the Dude's mob.
There names are on file.
Use every man in the Department if you have to.
I want those yeggs shadowed 24 hours a day, starting right now.
So get going!
- Mommy.
- Sorry, darling.
There, go to sleep. Good night.
Good night, Mommy.
The music must be soft and mellow.
Nothing harsh, nothing raucous.
Our guests have very delicate nerves.
Play at intervals of 10 minutes.
Do we understand each other?
Let it happen.
- Are these the two men?
- Yes, sir.
- Do they know their requirements?
- I've explained everything, sir.
Excellent, john.
Then put some on me.
Put some there.
You're quite sure it looks all right?
- Don't want it to go wrong.
- Yes, madam.
Come in.
Do my eyes deceive me, or am I in the presence of an angel?
Stop it, judge.
Never in all my questionable career have I gazed upon such divine loveliness.
Stop it, judge. Honestly, how do I look?
Exquisite!
- What time are they coming?
- Eight o'clock, my love.
- You think they can do it?
- Do it?
They'll do it, or else!
Dude's been rehearsing them till they're ready to drop.
- I'm so nervous.
- There, there, my little dewdrop.
Don't you worry.
If anything happens, I'll be there to cover up.
- Leave it to the old judge.
- Oh, you're so good.
Dude and his whole mob are up in Missouri Martin's and there's a sign on the joint: 'CIOSED'.
I didn't find out what it's about but it sure looks phony.
There's a line of cars outside a block long.
Don't let 'em get away from you.
What's more, don't let Dude find out he's being watched.
He's a pretty shrew article.
Okay, keep in touch with me.
- Hello?
- Moore there?
- Yes, sir.
- Put him on.
Moore talking.
Moore, better get the riot squad ready, 25 men.
Machine guns, tear bombs, everything.
- We may have a job on our hands.
- Alright, sir.
Sometimes, Count, I'm a little ashamed of my fellow Americans, they way they fawn at and worship celebrities.
- It's rather charming.
- They're like children.
You'll notice it tonight.
In your presence... they'll probably stammer and become tongue-tied.
I beg of you to make allowances for them.
Of course.
Different countries, different characteristics.
Which reminds me... there is custom in my country which obviously is not American.
I was waiting for you to mention it.
- What is that, Count?
- The dowry, my dear judge.
Nothing has been said about the dowry.
- The dowry?
- The dowry.
The dowry.
I'm aware that in America it is not considered very important, but in my country...
An old Spanish custom, huh?
A very old, old custom.
I don't know what to say, Count. You crept up on me with that one.
What was that you say?
I say I wasn't quite prepared for this.
It's a delicate subject, you know?
Perhaps you do not realize who your son is marrying?
A Manville, sir!
A descendant of the General of the Revolutionary War,
George Washington Manville.
You have heard of him?
I'm sorry, but I have not.
Well, that's strange.
And on her mother's side she comes from the purest stock.
Do you know that, if not for them, there would be no apple industry in America?
No doubt, no doubt.
But my son too comes from an old and distinguished family, yet I am making settlement equal to 50,000 dollars.
You are?
Perhaps you'd make a similar one?
I don't know about that.
If you don't wish to discuss it...
Well, look at this.
Billiards.
Why did you not tell me you had a billiards room?
Do you play?
Do I play?
In Valencia, I am champion!
Isn't that just... you don't say?
Perhaps, before the guests arrive, we might...
Nothing would give me greater pleasure.
Now...
- About the dowry, Count...
- Yes?
...it occurs to me, if the children will live in Spain with you... I shall give the whole amount.
No, no.
I would not let you do that.
After all, it is only 100,000 dollars.
Yes, that's true, but why should you bear the entire burden?
No, nothing at all I assure you.
I can well afford it.
For that matter, so can I.
You're so gracious, I am ashamed.
Nothing would give me greater pleasure than to take care of it.
- No, that would be unfair.
- But Señor, I want to do it.
No, no, no.
I'm on the daughter's side.
- I have that right.
- Well, Señor, I insist.
This is silly.
We might go on like this for hours.
In America, we have ways of settling this.
We toss coins, or pull straws...
What amuses you, Count?
I was just thinking, I could take advantage of you.
- Yes?
How?
- By suggesting billiards.
- I don't see why not.
- No, no.
It would be most unfair.
Perhaps it won't be.
You never can tell.
- Do you play well?
- Do I play well?
I practically make my living at it.
I warned you.
Everybody on their toes.
And no drinkin', understand?
It won't last more than 4 hours.
They catch a boat at midnight.
Everybody remember who they're supposed to be?
Yeah.
What ya got in mind for me, Dave?
A society leader in New York, Missouri.
Tryin' to insult me?
I'm one of the family, see?
If there's an uncle, there's an aunt.
Folks, meet the wife of Uncle Dave the Dude Manville.
Look out, Dude, she's sneakin' up on ya again.
Okay, anything you want.
Well, that's set.
And remember, you palookas, you're gentlemen, see?
Come on, Happy.
Dave, I wanna tell ya what a swell thing you're doing.
And I love you for it!
Wife, huh?
Go on, get away from me.
Hello, Smiley.
Look out, Dude.
Cops.
Been trailing ya all day.
What's the matter?
- What's the matter, Dave?
- Cops! Millions of them.
Cops?
I thought you said this was on the up and up?
- If there's anything screwy.
- Shut up!
Come on, Nick, take it easy.
We can't go to the Marberry now.
They'll follow us.
- What are we gonna do?
- Do? It's cold. We call it off.
Call off nothing.
Let me figure it.
What luck!
Amazing, isn't it?
I've been most fortunate.
You realize, if you make this point, you win?
Really?
I'll have to make it then.
I'm afraid that shot is practically impossible, Count.
- It can be made.
- Yes, you think so?
You shave the white one very fine, go round the table, meet the red one down here.
That's too much for me, Count.
Take an expert to do that.
Pardon me, sir.
Your brother is on the phone for you.
- Brother David?
- Yes, sir.
He says it's important.
I shall be there directly.
You made it!
Oh, most fortunate.
Hello?
Yes, this is he.
Congratulate me, David.
I just saved you 50,000 dollars.
Never mind that stuff.
Listen, we're in a jam.
We're stymied at Missouri Martin's. The place is surrounded by cops.
Cops?
I don't like that at all, my dear Dude.
You suggest I fold my tent and scram into the night?
Don't budge outta the place.
Stay there and stall till I figure something out.
Just as you say, Dude.
But I hardly relish being left holding the well-known bag.
What is it, judge?
What happened?
Nothing at all, my dear.
I heard you say something about the cops.
- They're not coming here, are they?
- No, of course not.
Don't fool me, judge.
Tell me the truth.
Don't get worked up.
You've got to keep your head.
Yes, but I'm the one...
I ought to know.
Don't fool me.
I'd rather go in there and tell them the truth myself!
Stinkin' cops are still out there.
Thank you.
When are the guests supposed to get here?
I don't know, sir.
- Could you tell me...?
- No, sir.
What are we going to do?
What if the police come here?
What'll I say to the Count?
What'll I say to Louise?
Quiet now, Annie.
The police aren't coming here.
Poor Louise.
Poor sweet and lovely girl.
- Don't you think, judge?
- Of course.
Suppose...
Suppose the Count should call the wedding off?
It'd kill Louise.
And she'd hate me.
Now don't be silly, Annie.
She'll want to know... about her father.
What will I say to her?
What will I tell her?
I never was married, judge.
Now, dear.
You don't have to tell her anything.
All these years I've kept it from her and she must never find out.
Oh no, please...
- Annie, be quiet.
- No, please.
- Don't let her find out.
- Annie, control yourself.
Listen, you think I'd come here if it wasn't on the level?
You gotta take my word.
You got to lay off me tonight!
What else do you want, the key to the city?
What's all your gang doing up at Missouri Martin's?
- They're having a clambake.
- Nothing you'd be interested in.
But I can't tell you about it.
If I could, you'd see how silly it is to make all this fuss.
Just lay off me tonight. I'll do anything.
I'll help you find those reporters.
- That's what you want, isn't it?
- Sure.
Where you got them, Dude?
I ain't got them, but I send the word round, those reporters will be back at their desks tomorrow.
Just call off your men till 12 o'clock tonight.
Sorry, Dude. Can't do business.
You'll have a police escort until those reporters show up.
If that's the way you feel, I'll tell ya something.
You're right!
I have got those reporters.
But they're not going to show up, see?
They won't show up until I'm good and ready to produce 'em.
- Now will you do business?
- Sure, we'll do business.
Mac.
So you've got the reporters, huh?
I thought so.
Arrest these two guys.
This won't do you any good.
You can always do business with the Police Department.
- Yes, sir?
- Get me the Mayor on the phone.
I don't think you can get him.
He's got a party for the Governor.
I'll get him when he finds out it's about the reporters.
I wouldn't be surprised if the Mayor made a deal with you. Probably settle for 50 years.
Don't be a sap, Commissioner.
Why drag the Mayor into this?
You want those reporters, don't ya?
The newspapers are making a sucker out of you.
Now you can come out on top.
What?
Well, tell him it's about those reporters. Yes.
There ain't anything crooked about this whole thing.
You'd laugh your head off if you heard the story.
Sure, I'm laughing right now.
- Hello, Chief.
- Wait a minute.
Before you talk to him, I'll tell you the whole story.
You'll think I'm nuts, but here's the real lowdown.
Say, you believe in fairy tales, don't you?
What?
No, it's no use.
I'll hang before I let you give me the horselaugh.
Talk to the Mayor, talk to anybody you want, but I'll tell you one thing, you'll never see those reporters.
Hello, Chief.
I've got Dave the Dude right here.
Yes, he admits having the three reporters.
He does, huh?
Call the Governor.
Governor.
Dave the Dude admits having the reporters.
Good!
Have they arrested him yet?
Sure they've arrested him, Governor.
But what will happen now?
In the morning a bail bond will get him out again.
- That's ridiculous.
- It how it works in this town.
He's got a colossal nerve.
He can't make any deals with the Police Department.
There's an example for you.
He wants to make a deal with us.
Says if we don't leave him alone tonight, we'll never see them.
- That's outrageous!
- Don't get excited, Governor.
It's the customary procedure.
Bring Dave the Dude up here.
Yes, that's exactly what I said.
Bring him up here.
Don't worry about my guests.
This is more important.
You gentlemen have freely criticized this administration. Let's see what you can do.
I'll let you spread him all over the front pages!
I'd send a criminal like that away for life!
Here's your chance, Governor.
It was all going to be so simple.
Ask them if they believe in fairy tales.
Look at their skulls.
It's a rare privilege.
- It's a rare... - Stop!
Stop, Cheesecake.
I don't mind tellin' ya you smell to high heaven.
Why don't ya learn this like I told ya?
- You get worse every time.
- Shakespeare, I'm wore out.
How can a guy unlax if he's all wore out?
Listen, Simon Legree, we been doin' this for hours.
The Dude said to keep practicing, didn't he?
So, we're going to practice.
Now everybody.
Up on your feet.
Throw yourself into it!
Do it like I told ya.
Close the door, Stuttgart.
Come on, Lefty, get into it.
Now, the Apple Annie speech.
Keep on practicing.
Don't stop.
Hello, Dude.
But Dude, we're all set. Everyone's been practicing.
Everybody looks swell.
Okay, Dude.
- I'll tell 'em.
- What's the matter?
- Dude says it's all off.
- It can't be!
Dude said it was all off.
Everyone send back the suits.
What a break for Annie.
You try to do something decent and they won't let ya.
Poor Annie.
Mother...
Mother... ls there anything wrong?
I heard the Count saying there won't be any reception.
Isn't anybody coming?
My baby.
- Louise, darling?
- Yes, Mother.
If anything should happen, you'd never hate your mother?
Don't say things like that.
Please don't say things like that.
Is the Count in the drawing room?
Yes.
Annie, where are you going?
Where are you going?
Count Romero, I want a few moments to talk with you.
There's nothing more in the world I want more than for Louise to marry your son. He's a dear boy.
Louise loves him, loves him dearly.
And I'm quite sure he loves her, too.
Ever since she was born, I've had but one thought in my mind, her happiness.
When she wrote and told me she found someone she loved,
I think I was the happiest mother in the world.
Count Romero, you came over here to find out something about her... about her family, about me.
I don't blame you.
You had a perfect right.
You knew nothing about us.
It would be terrible if, after they were married, you came to find out that... her mother was someone you would be ashamed of.
Someone even she would be ashamed of.
That's silly, Mother. That's silly.
That's why I wanted to have this talk with you, Count Romero.
I wanted to tell you all about us.
I want to tell you...
His Honor, the Mayor!
Go ahead, Mayor.
Do your stuff.
It's your idea.
My dear Mrs. Manville, so good to see you again!
The last time was at your very lovely party at Briarwood. I'll never forget it. Brilliant.
And this, I assume, is your very charming daughter.
Count Romero and his son, Carlos.
How do you do?
Welcome to our city.
I recognize you at once, Mayor.
I've seen you in the newsreels.
- Thank you.
- Delighted, madam.
- It's a miracle.
- Two miracles.
The Governor.
His Excellency, The Governor!
What did you say old Apple Annie's name was?
Mrs. E. Worthington Manville.
- Goodness sake, don't forget it!
Mrs. Manville, I can't tell you what a pleasure, what a privilege it is for us, to be here tonight at your wonderful reception.
Your charming daughter, I presume?
The Governor's taking us down to the boat.
Not bad, huh?
As a kid, they had a tough time making me believe in Santa Claus.
Look, Father. A police escort!
That's more than they do for us in Valencia.
You are very influential, my friend.
This?
Nothing at all. Nothing, I assure you.
An admirable woman.
A delightful experience.
Made me feel 10 years younger.
I suppose, Governor, now that you're in town, you'll follow up that investigation down at city hall.
No, I think we've been a little bit harsh with them.
I guess I've been a bit impatient with the administration, Mayor.
- Sorry about my attitude tonight.
- That's all right.
I must remember to call up the Commissioner tomorrow.
I've been making his life miserable.
You boys gotta excuse me if I get a bit tough on you one in a while.
I know you're doing your best.
Okay, Commissioner, okay.
That's the way you'll write the story.
Got that clear?
What about us being kidnapped?
Who said you were kidnapped?
You were on a drunk, understand?
Drunk?
- You're passing up on this story?
- You were out on a drunk!
Hold onto it!
Goodbye.
Goodbye. Goodbye, Mother.
Yes, J.L.
Yes, J.L.
–I've been waiting a half hour.
–Not now, I'm busy.
Got to get all his sons–in–lay on the phone.
Maine 674.
Board of directors meeting tonight.
This is the first.
They know there's a meeting tonight.
The whole town knows it.
Just the same, J.L. Insists notifying officially.
Hello, Higgins Hardware?
Mr. Early, please.
Higgins.
Higgins!
That's not a family, it's a disease.
Henry Early speaking.
Yes, Mrs. Petersen.
I just want to remind you there's a board meeting at 7 sharp.
Arthur Winslow talking.
Yes, Mrs. Petersen.
Naturally.
The usual time, yes.
Mr. Brooks hasn't been in all day.
I don't know.
You've got to him and tell him his father–in–law expects him.
Yes, Mrs. Peterson.
Have you tried his home?
His wife might...
She's hung up.
We've got to find Mr. Brooks.
That's ridiculous.
He must be in his office.
He's not... and you know how strict your father is about meetings.
I'll see that he gets there.
I think I know where he is.
All right, Whitey.
Here comes the home stretch.
Come on!
Come on, Broadway Bill!
Princess, hurry up.
Take him to the barn.
I'll see you there.
Hot digidy!
–What he do it in?
–1 minute, 40 seconds.
–1:40?
–Yeah.
Gee, that knocks another second off.
He's liable to break the world's record.
Hi, Bill.
Ata boy.
–He can sure pick 'em up.
–He's still stalling.
–Stalling?
–Yeah.
–Going as fast as you can see.
–Nice work.
–He's great.
–What's this?
She taught Skeeter to do that.
–Skeeter?
–Miss named him that way.
You got a mascot, pal.
–Biggest pals.
–You know more about him than I do.
You hang around a lot, Princes.
–Make something of it?
–For Emperor Higgins.
Don't let him catch it.
Emperor Higgins doesn't know I'm alive.
I'm just the young brat.
Get married, give him another son–in–law.
Someone to take care of another Higgins enterprise.
No, thanks
–I'm coming.
–Walk him around for about an hour.
–Any carrots?
–Six, but no more.
Not seven?
Take care of him or I'll break your neck.
Come on, Bill.
A great horse!
I wish he run right now.
He's got background, stamina.
Ana a will to win.
That's important in a horse.
The Imperial Racetrack opened last week.
Don't you think I know it?
I saw you boyfriend, Bill Taylor.
–Why don't you?
–Don't what?
Take Broadway Bill down to the track.
Are you crazy?
What are you waiting for?
You've been dying to get out of Higginsville.
Your heart is in horses and you're making paper boxes.
It doesn't make sense.
–What's got into you?
–Oh.
You're a fool, daddy.
–I am, huh?
–Yes.
You've become another Higgins' slave.
–Mind if I have an idea?
–What is it?
I've always been honest.
I'd cut off my right arm before I'd lie to you.
What is it?
I read my bible and don't mess around.
What do you want to tell me?
I've been adding' things up.
And subtracting, dividing and multiplying. And get the same answer.
It wouldn't be honest to race Bill for anyone else.
Who asked you?
Go on, get out of here.
–Yes, sir.
–See you.
Come on, Bill.
Mr. Brooks!
Your wife wants you to come right home.
–There's a meeting tonight.
–Beat it.
–But she...
–Get out of here, I told you!
I was just trying to tell you.
It's very important.
–Margaret...
–Yes?
He made 1:40.
How's that?
–Who made 1:40?
–Broadway Bill.
With Whitey. He must weight at least 150.
There's a meeting tonight.
Finish dressing.
Let's dock the meeting.
You take a bath?
Sure.
Smells horsy to me.
I'll take 4 if we dock the meeting.
–Don't be silly.
–There's a full moon.
Let's go out and sit under it all night.
Or 2 nights, a week.
What do you say?
What's eating you?
Same old bugs.
Father'd have a royal fit if we didn't show up.
We've got to go.
Hang the meeting.
What difference does it make?
Your father'll do all the talking, and we'll go:
Yes, J.L. Of course, J.L.
I've got a chronic pain in my neck from nodding.
Don't be a fool.
Let's go throw rock as the meeting.
You say such stupid things.
Let's do something else.
Why don't you get a zipper?
Some day you'll be calling the meetings and won't want rocks.
They'd be absolute idiots.
Now hurry up, we're going to be late.
–What about the moon?
–Come on.
–Margaret...
–Good heavens.
–I know I'm a pest.
–We'll never get there!
I'm serious.
What if I tell you I'm miserable here... dying a slow death?
Would you go away with me?
–Where to?
–Anywhere... where I can make my own living, do what I want.
The racing business, I suppose.
I'm not interested in making paper boxes.
Do you really want me to give up all this?
Why not?
Live not knowing where my next meal's coming from.
–Wait for miracles.
–It's better than this.
Doesn't it bother you your husband's a parasite?
That's what I am.
There's no use kidding myself.
I've got a job cause I married you.
Father thinks you're terribly clever.
That's why the others are jealous.
He has great plans for you, and someday...
Yeah, I know.
A crown prince.
–Good evening, Johnson.
–Evening, Mr. Mrs. Early.
J.L.'s in the study.
–Good evening, J.L. –Good evening.
Father.
Good evening, father.
Don't scold, I'm on time.
J.L.'s in the study.
You're not the smartest, but the best–looking.
Thanks.
Henry, Matilda.
Good evening, father.
–J.L. –Good evening.
–Mrs. Brooks, Mr. Brooks.
–Hello, Johnson.
J.L.'s in the study. Yes, sir.
–Good evening.
–Hello.
Hello, dad.
Hello, Princess.
–You're late.
–I know.
It's all my fault.
We'll get started.
Want to know it was?
You and Broadway were talking too long.
Think I'll be thrown into the Bastille?
You'll be lucky if not beheaded.
Before I go to the chopping block... could you dig up a slug of whiskey?
Whiskey, in this house?
Doesn't anything change around this mausoleum?
Yes, bedspreads and underwear.
That's something.
Regarding the Acme Lumber Company... we bought it today.
And this morning it's become the Higgins Lumber Company.
I trust that meets with your approval.
Sure.
Naturally.
I trust it meets with yours.
Naturally, J.L.
For the present, it has no active head... and shall remain so... until the one vacant chair here... becomes suitably populated.
If you're referring to me, you're wasting your time.
What's that?
The man I marry won't care for the lumber business.
–Don't be impudent.
–I'm sorry.
There's no further discussion of business... until after dinner.
I'm happy to say all the Higgins enterprises are doing well.
All except the Higgins Paper Box Company.
I'm sorry to report sales have dropped to a dangerous extend.
I have the figures in front of me.
The first 3 months of the fiscal year... style 4, all colors, dropped 14%.
The Higgins Special we manufactured for 20 years... with which we are nationally identified... 22%.
The Company needs more application of its management.
You can't expect a business to flourish when the head... is off gallivanting with a horse.
What's your point?
–My point?
–Yes.
It's quite obvious.
You came here 3 years ago penniless and... with a questionable background.
Some sort of association with the racetrack business.
I was broadminded enough to overlook that.
You and Margaret wanted to get married and I approved.
I put you at the head of the Higgins Box Company... on of the largest and successful of the Higgins enterprises.
You accepted that responsibility with enthusiasm... and I might even say gratitude.
You were the envy of Mr. Early and Mr. Winslow.
Your first 2 years were successful.
But this past year the company has suffered immeasurably.
I attribute it to one cause:
Neglect.
Shameful neglect.
Beginning tomorrow morning, you will devote yourself... exclusively to your business.
And get rid of that horse.
See that it's done.
I've gone over the books of the Acme Lumber Company.
Cash on hand and in banks, $13,672 and 86 cents. Accounts receivable, $32,842...
Wait a minute, Mr. Higgins.
I won't sell my horse.
I'm leaving Higginsville in the morning.
Quiet!
What you say is true.
I have neglected the business.
The reason's simple:
I've always hated it.
It's a good business.
It's all right... for you, or Mr. Winslow, or Mr. Early.
They are suited to it, and I'm not.
I may sound crazy, and maybe I am but, you strike me the same.
Everything seems lopsided.
Higginsville, the Higgins family... the Higgins enterprises.
We don't speak the same language.
You're interested only in... accumulating money, expanding, bobbling up the little ones.
You've just snatched Acme away from some poor people.
–Hope it makes you happy.
–Careful with what you say!
You haven't taken a vacation in 40 years, rotting away in your kingdom.
If that's your idea of high living... it isn't mine, nor Margaret's.
I wouldn't get rid of that horse for you or anybody else.
Someday you'll take off your hat to Broadway Bill.
I was broke when I came here, but we want nothing from Higginsville.
Accept my resignation.
I'll wait for you in the car, Margaret.
You needn't bother.
The meeting's adjourned.
Why shouldn't I applaud him?
He should have gone long ago.
What sort of talk is this?
Your little monarchy is fast folding up.
Your crown prince is through.
Stop this nonsense!
You're a strong and powerful ruler, oh mighty king.
But you're not going to crush him any longer.
What's the matter with you?
You seem very happy he's going.
I'm so happy I could shriek.
I could go out on rooftops and shriek.
I prayed for him every night.
I hope he never sets foot in Higginsville again.
Oh, father.
Look, look.
I feel 10 years younger.
How you feel?
I'm headed for the last roundup.
The time has arrived.
I'm gonna leave sad times aside.
I'm headed for the last roundup.
Hey, what's up?
–What's up?
–She's here, Gallant Lady.
Gallant Lady?
I gotta take a look.
Hello, Dan.
Where've you been all these years?
Hiding under rocks.
Bradshaw, come here.
–Where do you think you're going?
–Hello, Mike.
Get back there.
I can't bring Gallant Lady out like this. She's too nervous.
Get off the platform.
Get back, will you?
Officer, do your duty.
Don't tell me what to do.
Okay, Mr. Whitehall.
All right, get her out of here.
Bring her out.
Keep her head down, watch her feet.
–That's a beautiful animal.
–She'll win the Derby.
Make way.
Hello, Mr. Morgan.
Dan Brooks, remember me?
–How are you?
–Fine, thank you.
–Who you betting on?
–Gallant Lady, of course.
Don't put your money down yet, I may have some use for it.
–We were betting on Sun Up.
–Why not broadcast it?
Don't be a sucker, you haven't a chance with that horse.
Try some small races first.
I'm coming back in style.
Nobody knows anything about Broadway Bill, and if he wins...
You don't believe he can beat Gallant Lady, do you?
Why not?
–In his first race?
–I know what he can do.
How much is the entry?
I give up.
You must have rapped your senses in paper boxes.
$500.
It's a $25,000 race.
That's cheap enough.
–You make out the check?
–Now?
You can do it the day before the race, it's in 2 weeks.
Yes, I'm having funds transferred.
You've got to nominate him before 6 o'clock, today.
How much?
$50.
50?
I'll be right back.
How much money you got?
–Money?
–Yeah, bring it out.
You've come to the wrong place.
I got this one, sad and lonesome dollar.
I'm short 5.
Bring it up.
–$5? –Yes.
I'm the poorest man you ever did see.
See that?
If there's any money there, I'd be surprised.
–Bless my soul!
–That's what I say.
Hey, boot, you ain't my pocketbook no more.
–Your receipt.
–Thanks.
How about a stable?
I had one left and just gave it to Gallant Lady.
Whitehall insisted on having it to himself.
He'd take Gallant Lady out of the race if...
Without Gallant Lady you wouldn't have an attraction.
That's it.
Go over and see Pop Jones.
He hangs out around the warehouse.
He's got an old barn.
–Okay, thanks.
–I'm awfully sorry.
Broadway Bill's been brought up in a barn all his life.
–Good luck.
–Thanks.
What do we eat with?
When I get hungry, I get hungry.
When you're hungry, eat.
Can't go without food.
Ain't gonna do my stomach no good.
Where we get the money to buy it with?
We'll have to rely on the old man with the whiskers.
–Who that?
–A miracle man.
When he puts his arm around you, you're troubles are over.
A good man to meet up with.
Looks all right, Pop.
We've had some pretty fine horses here.
Yeah?
–Who's the feed man here?
–Hey?
The feed man?
–Feed man?
–Yes.
Right here.
I want a supply of stuff sent in.
Some oats, bran, barley, carrots and... about 10 pounds of salt.
For cash or credit?
What do you mean?
Don't you trust me?
I don't know you...
I settle all my bills at the end of the week.
–I need cash...
–And a couple of cots, Pop.
–Hey?
–A couple of cots.
–Cots?
–Something you sleep on.
To sleep here?
You don't think...?
You don't know it, but there's the winner of the Derby.
Think I'll let him stay by himself?
I'll show you how you can clean up a bankroll.
That horse is a sleeper.
–A what?
–A sleeper.
You want a cot for the horse too?
You hear Pop?
You're quite a kidder.
Come on, it's feeding time.
–Whitey.
–Yes?
We gotta get to the bank and make that deposit.
That's for sure.
You still here?
We got to get that feed in.
Hurry up.
How was that?
He fell like a log.
A little slow though.
See his eyes?
The old man with the whiskers is working already.
Mr. Brooks!
Them clothes sure is elegant.
Think Colonel Pettigrew will be impressed?
Colonel Pettigrew?
Who that?
A gentleman, Whitey.
With great understanding and a soul.
A man to borrow money from, if he has it.
Borrow?
When I borrow I were my old close, my rundown shoes.
–You got funny ideas.
–That's the secret.
Never look down and out, no matter how hungry you are.
You sure got the secret.
If he's got money, you'll get it.
All he's got to do is look at them clothes.
Colonel Pettigrew.
I hope he's got 500 bucks.
–Colonel Pettigrew?
–Yes?
Take your feet off my chair.
Yes, my love.
A fortune.
Just by investing the sum of $50.
Stop dreaming.
Where you gonna get $50?
You can be very annoying.
Don't do us no good with those phone numbers you're popping.
–That's 5,000 you owe me.
–Double or nothing.
No you don't.
Last season I had you up to $80,000.
I traded, didn't I?
–For a buck and a quarter.
–But in cash.
–See if you can find a flaw.
–I read fairy tales at night.
It won't be when I get the 50.
Then go to work.
I'll have it without work.
Where from, vinegar–puss?
–Colonel Pettigrew.
–Yes, my love.
A man who races horses...
Dan Brooks, a very dear friend of mine.
Anybody had $50 wouldn't be a friend of yours.
Dan Brooks' got a thousand times 50 and never turned me down.
We're his guests at lunch today.
–He'll buy us lunch?
–At the Ritz Hotel.
Colonel!
My old and trusted friend!
Glad to see ya.
Meet my business associate Oscar McGuire, known as Happy.
This is Dan Brooks.
–How do you do?
–How are you?
Come on, sit down.
–It's been a long time.
–Yes.
I'm a starving man.
Bring me the whole lunch.
I'll take the same, please.
The same for you, sir?
–I'm not here to make a speech.
–Right, sir.
Colonel, you look fine.
I hear you're rolling in wealth.
Just so–so.
Don't believe all the stories you hear.
I was talking to the boys and they agree.
You know they exaggerate.
–How about you?
–Holding my own, that's all.
Don't be modest.
Racing horses again, aren't ya?
Just keep my hand in.
That's what I always said about you.
I always said:
Dan Brooks? A lad who'll come through.
How long does this go on?
Don't mind him, Friday the 13th.
Here's your soup... and one more soup.
I'm glad I run into you, Dan.
I got a proposition to clean up $160,000, and want you in on it.
–That so?
–Just for old time sake.
–That's nice of you.
–Nothing at all.
I'll need a little financing though.
You'll need what?
With a start of $50, I got a pile of...
You're not by any chance trying to borrow $50 from me, are you?
Not borrow, exactly.
Wait a minute.
I came here to borrow $500.
–Don't tell me you're broke?
–Yes, totally.
–And you came...?
–Yeah.
–And I came...?
–Yeah.
That's the funniest!
What's son funny about that?
–Everything satisfactory?
–Yeah.
–How broke are you?
–A veritable pauper.
Not even enough for the meal?
–No.
How about you?
–No.
No, no, no!
Gentlemen, we're in a situation.
I haven't been thrown out of a place like this in years.
–You finished, gentlemen?
–Yes, quite.
–Finished?
–Yes.
Waiter.
Come here.
What's the idea?
I'll never come here again!
I'm so sorry.
Here they are, red–hot.
–You're a good trader.
–It's not the size I wanted.
What did you expect for a hamburger, a telephone pole?
I ain't kickin', but...
I ought to have a hat.
–Give you a Coke for the hat.
–Don't like Coke.
–A pie for the tie.
–Forget the tie.
–You have to have dessert.
–Look.
We may be in for dinner tonight.
Spats.
You should ought to see me in spats.
–There we go.
–I'm a sight for sore eyes.
–Another hamburger for the spats.
–Maybe tonight.
Okay, dinner tonight for the hat, spats and tie.
It's a deal.
We got a little business.
You mind?
Oh, sure.
If you got anything for my wife...
Bring her in and we'll cut her up.
Smart guy, huh?
What now?
Raising $500 is no child's play.
You're a great disappointment.
From what you say, Broadway Bill must be a superb animal.
If I can get him in that race.
Don't worry, that's as good as done.
My time and wisdom are devoted to your welfare.
I'm sorry for you.
I got an ace in the hole, Edna.
A 50 to 1 shot.
You got to marry her first.
Who's Edna?
That vinegar–puss landlady at the boarding house.
Why she expect to marry you?
I encouraged her. An economic necessity, you know.
That'll give you an idea of what I've been driven to.
Driven to, my eye.
He'd rather make false love to her than to go to work.
Trouble is he's got a landlady in every town in the country.
It's kept me in food and lodging for years.
And you too.
Do you think she'd fall for a Ford truck?
That's a perfect mating.
Quiet!
I'm not kiddin', Happy.
I got a Ford truck I want to sell for $35.
But we need 500.
There are small races tomorrow with $500 stakes.
If we win one, we're home.
Broadway Bill is a breeze.
We need $35 for expenses. 10 for a jockey, 25 for nomination.
An inspiration.
That's as good as in the bag.
Vinegar–puss will own a Ford truck... even if I have to make the supreme sacrifice.
Bravo!
–It's a long shot.
–Got to try it.
–Is this it? –Yes.
Sturdy and dependable.
–What is it?
–Does it look like a lawnmower?
Might as well be.
Come on, beloved, Broadway Bill's in the 2nd race.
Oh, darling!
I couldn't sleep last night thinking of you.
–You make love so beautifully!
–That's only the beginning.
Let's go.
Give them plenty of start.
I can still hear them.
What's the matter?
They've been there 10 minutes.
Having trouble with Broadway Bill.
Turn him round there.
Hold him.
Get back there.
Turn him around and bring him in here.
–Guess he ain't ready yet.
–Sure he is.
Nervous in his first race.
He'll outrun them all.
Hold him!
Don't let him through.
Number 5.
That horse is half nuts.
Joe, we're going home.
That's the end of Broadway Bill in this race.
–Don't let him start again.
–AII right.
Poor Dan.
I wonder what he's going to do with Broadway Bill now.
–Hello, darling.
–Hello.
–That's a nice robe.
–Thank you.
–Any news from Dan?
